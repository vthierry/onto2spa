	abstract = {Associative memories are conventionally used to represent data with very simple structure: sets of pairs of vectors. This paper describes a method for representing more complex compositional structure in distributed representations. The method uses circular convolution to associate items, which are represented by vectors. Arbitrary variable bindings, short sequences of various lengths, simple frame-like structures, and reduced representations can be represented in a fixed width vector. These representations are items in their own right and can be used in constructing compositional structures. The noisy reconstructions extracted from convolution memories can be cleaned up by using a separate associative memory that has good reconstructive properties.},

This paper discusses recent analyses and extensions of the LCA model. First, it reviews the dynamics and examines the conditions that make the model achieve optimal performance. Second, it shows that nonlinearities of the type present in biological neurons improve performance when the number of choice alternatives increases. Third, the model is extended to value-based choice, where it is shown that nonlinearities in the value function explain risk aversion in risky choice and preference reversals in choice between alternatives characterized across multiple dimensions.},

	abstract = {Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks. Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.},

	abstract = {Along evolution, increasingly complex cognitive functions have been attributed to an increasingly complex brain architecture. Nevertheless, the brain remains anchored on an organization dedicated to survival. We believe that keeping this principle in mind is an excellent way to better decipher cerebral mechanisms and corresponding cognitive functions. Accordingly, we describe here the main characteristics and constraints of an intelligent agent learning to survive in an intelligent environment, in terms of information ﬂows and learning principles. On this basis, we propose a framework of description for the architecture of the brain of mammals, organized around four fundamental questions to be answered. These questions deﬁne the identity of the goal (what ?) and the motivation to choose it (why ?), its location (where ?) and the way to get it (how ?). Then we explain how the main requirements of respondent and operant conditioning can be addressed within this architecture and how it is also compatible with the elaboration of more complex cognitive mechanisms. This can be seen as the validation of this framework to explore how cognitive functions might emerge from cerebral circuits and how they have been made more complex along evolution. It also proposes a systemic view of the brain, useful to develop the cognitive architecture of an intelligent agent exploring autonomously its environment and to propose to machine learning innovative algorithms.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a framework for modelling dopamine function in the mammalian brain. It proposes that both learning and action planning involve processes minimizing prediction errors encoded by dopaminergic neurons. In this framework, dopaminergic neurons projecting to different parts of the striatum encode errors in predictions made by the corresponding systems within the basal ganglia. The dopaminergic neurons encode differences between rewards and expectations in the goal-directed system, and differences between the chosen and habitual actions in the habit system. These prediction errors trigger learning about rewards and habit formation, respectively. Additionally, dopaminergic neurons in the goal-directed system play a key role in action planning: They compute the difference between a desired reward and the reward expected from the current motor plan, and they facilitate action planning until this difference diminishes. Presented models account for dopaminergic responses during movements, effects of dopamine depletion on behaviour, and make several experimental predictions.},

In the ﬁeld of games, Unity is one of the most used engines and allows the development of intelligent agents in virtual environments. However, although Unity allows working in multiagent environments, it does not provide functionalities to facilitate the development of MAS. The aim of this work is to create a multiagent system in Unity. For this purpose, a predator–prey problem was designed in which the agents must cooperate to arrest a thief driven by a human player. To solve this cooperative problem, it is required to create the representation of the environment and the agents in 3D; to equip the agents with vision, contact, and sound sensors to perceive the environment; to implement the agents’ behaviors; and, ﬁnally but not less important, to build a communication system between agents that allows negotiation, collaboration, and cooperation between them to create a complex, role-based chasing strategy.},

Realism is not only related to visual appearance but also to the interactions and situations in the game. This issue is particularly crucial in edutainment applications where realism impacts the learning aspect of the game experience. Introducing semantics in virtual worlds helps deﬁne intelligent objects and interactions which would turn into a more realistic game. In this work, we propose to decouple the semantic deﬁnition of the game world from its actual implementation in a general-purpose game engine. A semantic layer has been developed to bridge the semantics formalized by ontologies with its realization in the engine. Thanks to this software library, semantics can be speciﬁed in a separate formal module and reused in different projects. The proposed approach has been tested to design a serious game concept set in the marine environment.},

Then, we discuss how psychology and neuroscience have conceptualized curiosity and intrinsic motivation, studying how the brain can be intrinsically rewarded by novelty, complexity, or other measures of information. We explain how the framework of computational reinforcement learning can be used to model such mechanisms of curiosity. Then, we discuss the learning progress (LP) hypothesis, which posits a positive feedback loop between curiosity and learning. We outline experiments with robots that show how LP-driven attention and exploration can self-organize a developmental learning curriculum scaffolding efficient acquisition of multiple skills/tasks. Finally, we discuss recent work exploiting these conceptual and computational models in educational technologies, showing in particular how intelligent tutoring systems can be designed to foster curiosity and learning.},

De son coté, l'IA a pâti des limitations résultant de la dualité stricte entre connaissances et données.

	abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is conﬁgured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

Deep meta-RL involves a combination of three ingredients:

Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and deﬁne a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},

	abstract = {The frontal lobes subserve decision-making and executive control—that is, the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. Current models of frontal executive function, however, do not explain human decision-making in everyday environments featuring uncertain, changing, and especially open-ended situations. Here, we propose a computational model of human executive function that clarifies this issue. Using behavioral experiments, we show that unlike others, the proposed model predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations. The model reveals that for driving action, the human frontal function monitors up to three/four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online their ability to predict action outcomes: whenever one appears more reliable than unreliable, this strategy is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed, partly from those stored in long-term memory, then probed, and if competitive confirmed to subsequently drive action. Thus, the human executive function has a monitoring capacity limited to three or four behavioral strategies. This limitation is compensated by the binary structure of executive control that in ambiguous and unknown situations promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies. The results support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {The classic dichotomy between habitual and goal-directed behavior is often mapped onto a dichotomy between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, putatively implemented in segregated neuronal circuits. Despite significant heuristic value in motivating experimental investigations, several lines of evidence suggest that this mapping is in need of modification and/or realignment. First, whereas habitual and goal-directed behaviors have been shown to depend on cleanly separable neural circuitry, recent data suggest that model-based and model-free representations in the brain are largely overlapping. Second, habitual behaviors need not involve representations of expected reinforcement (i.e., need not involve RL, model-free, or otherwise) but may be based instead on simple stimulus–response associations. Finally, goal-directed decisions may not reflect a single model-based algorithm but rather a continuum of “model-basedness.” These lines of evidence thus suggest a possible reconceptualization of the distinction between model-free versus model-based RL—one in which both contribute to a single goal-directed system that is value-based, as opposed to distinct, habitual mechanisms that are value-free. In this chapter, we discuss new models that have extended the RL approach to modeling habitual and goal-directed behavior and assess how these have clarified our understanding of the underlying neural circuitry.},

Abstract

Habitual and goal-directed DO depend on separable circuits.BUT MB and MF are overlapping
Habitual behaviour is not necessarily RL (can be simple S-R association)
Goal-directed decisions may not reflect a single MB algo, but rather a continuum of MB-ness

Mine:

There may not be MF RL at all in the brain

Body

Habits form through repetition of prior actions, irrespective of whether those actions were positively reinforced. Habits may be value-free.
"The links between the animal (habitual/goal-directed) and ML (MF/MB) taxonomies are at the very least incomplete if not deeply misaligned"

habit system learns all the time, behaviour can then be "passed on" from the goal-directed system to the habitual. =cortical hebbian learning like in Aubin (2016) or Boraud (\& Rougier) (2018)

Belief-free/belief-based. Forming beliefs is helpful to infer states when not directly observable.
Belief-MDP solves the problem of aliasing (an agent cannot infer true state from obs because different states can be rewarded/look the same) by using a trace of previous observations for state inference
Partially observable MDP uses bayesian/kalman filters to infer states
Epistemic action (as opposed to pragmatic): aims at changing the agent's belief state in uncertain environment (e.g. get a cue) and not achieving an external goal
Friston et al. 2016 propose that a belief-free scheme is sufficient to characterize habitual systems, but that a belief-based scheme is necessary to characterize goal-directed systems
MB is infeasible in realistic environments, because needs to enumerate all states.
Approximation by exploring parts of search tree, random or heuristics.
DYNA: model-free incrementally updated through samples from world model
MB-ness forms a continuous dimension that varies in informational richness, so I wasn't that naive :)
the inflexibility of habitual control trades off with gains in speed and consistency of action
OMMMGGGGG dopamine signals MB not MF, and therefore there may not be MF in the brain at all !!!

	abstract = {Recent computational theories of decision making in humans and animals have portrayed 2 systems locked in a battle for control of behavior. One system—variously termed model-free or habitual—favors actions that have previously led to reward, whereas a second— called the model-based or goal-directed system—favors actions that causally lead to reward according to the agent’s internal model of the environment. Some evidence suggests that control can be shifted between these systems using neural or behavioral manipulations, but other evidence suggests that the systems are more intertwined than a competitive account would imply. In 4 behavioral experiments, using a retrospective revaluation design and a cognitive load manipulation, we show that human decisions are more consistent with a cooperative architecture in which the model-free system controls behavior, whereas the model-based system trains the model-free system by replaying and simulating experience.},

	abstract = {Several approaches to implementing symbol-like representations in neurally plausible models have been proposed. These approaches include binding through synchrony (Shastri \& Ajjanagadde, 1993), “mesh” binding (van der Velde \& de Kamps, 2006), and conjunctive binding (Smolensky, 1990). Recent theoretical work has suggested that most of these methods will not scale well, that is, that they cannot encode structured representations using any of the tens of thousands of terms in the adult lexicon without making implausible resource assumptions. Here, we empirically demonstrate that the biologically plausible structured representations employed in the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) approach to modeling cognition (Eliasmith, 2013) do scale appropriately. Speciﬁcally, we construct a spiking neural network of about 2.5 million neurons that employs semantic pointers to successfully encode and decode the main lexical relations in WordNet, which has over 100,000 terms. In addition, we show that the same representations can be employed to construct recursively structured sentences consisting of arbitrary WordNet concepts, while preserving the original lexical structure. We argue that these results suggest that semantic pointers are uniquely well-suited to providing a biologically plausible account of the structured representations that underwrite human cognition.},

	abstract = {Cultural-historical activity theory is a new framework aimed at transcending the dichotomies of micro- and macro-, mental and material, observation and intervention in analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often difficult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, offer possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated ‘knotworking’ across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing different perspectives and conceptualizations. Findings from a longitudinal intervention study of children's medical care illuminate the theoretical arguments.},

Two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for planning obstacle-avoiding paths for a system which exhibits nonholonomic constraints. The method is based on the use of harmonic functions. Linear constraints on the velocity of a nonholonomic system can be directly expressed as Neumann boundary conditions for a harmonic function. Such boundary conditions are easily represented in a resistive network. The resulting potential represents an integration of nonholonomic constraints over an admissible subset of configuration space. The method is applied to path planning for simple wheeled vehicles. 1 Introduction This paper draws on the relationship between harmonic functions and resistive networks to propose a new method for planning the motion of nonholonomic systems. Simple nonholonomic constraints [1] restrict the velocity of mechanical systems to a linear subspace of their configuration space. These constraints bear a resemblance to the Neumann boundary condition for harmonic functions. Although nonho...},

However, the literature is actually not explicit about how these terms can be deﬁned; whether they are distinct; and whether they refer to overt manifestations, learning processes, or learning outcomes. Thus, a framework is provided here that offers a way to differentiate active, constructive, and interactive in terms of observable overt activities and underlying learning processes. The framework generates a testable hypothesis for learning: that interactive activities are most likely to be better than constructive activities, which in turn might be better than active activities, which are better than being passive. Studies from the literature are cited to provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Moreover, postulating underlying learning processes allows us to interpret evidence in the literature more accurately. Specifying distinct overt activities for active, constructive, and interactive also offers suggestions for how learning activities can be coded and how each kind of activity might be elicited.},

It is often assumed that students master this complex cognitive skill of information problem solving all by themselves. In our point of view, however, explicit and intensive instruction is necessary. A skill decomposition is needed in order to design instruction that fosters the development of information problem solving. This research analyzes the information problem solving process of novices and experts in order to reach a detailed skill decomposition. Results reveal that experts spend more time on the main skill Ôdeﬁne problemÕ and more often activate their prior knowledge, elaborate on the content, and regulate their process. Furthermore, experts and novices show little diﬀerences in the way they search the Internet. These ﬁndings formed the basis for formulating instructional guidelines. Ó 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

First, novelty detection can be grounded in the sensorimotor experience and allow higher order appraisal. Second, cognitive processes, such as those involved in self-assessment, influence emotional states by eliciting affects like boredom and frustration. Third, emotional processes such as those triggered by self-assessment influence attentional processes. Last, close emotion-cognition interactions implement an efficient feedback loop for the purpose of top-down behavior regulation. The latter is what we call ‘Emotional Metacontrol’. We introduce a model based on artificial neural networks. This architecture is used to control a robotic system in a visual search task. The emotional metacontrol intervenes to bias the robot visual attention during active object recognition. Through a behavioral and statistical analysis, we show that this mechanism increases the robot performance and fosters the exploratory behavior to avoid deadlocks.},

This method represents continuous (i.e., real-valued) spaces using neurons, and identiﬁes a set of operations for manipulating these representations. Speciﬁcally, we use “fractional binding” to construct “spatial semantic pointers” (SSPs) that we use to generate and manipulate representations of spatial maps encoding the positions of objects. We show how these representations can be transformed to answer queries about the location and identities of objects, move the relative or global position of items, and answer queries about regions of space, among other things. We demonstrate that the neural implementation in spiking networks of SSPs have similar accuracy and capacity as the mathematical ideal.},

	abstract = {Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for representing and transforming continuous space, with numerous applications to cognitive modelling and deep learning. Fundamental to SSPs is the notion of "similarity" between vectors representing different points in \$n\$-dimensional space -- typically the dot product or cosine similarity between vectors with rotated unit-length complex coefficients in the Fourier domain. The similarity measure has previously been conjectured to be a Gaussian function of Euclidean distance. Contrary to this conjecture, we derive a simple trigonometric formula relating spatial displacement to similarity, and prove that, in the case where the Fourier coefficients are uniform i.i.d., the expected similarity is a product of normalized sinc functions: \${\textbackslash}prod\_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\} {\textbackslash}operatorname\{sinc\} {\textbackslash}left( a\_k {\textbackslash}right)\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{a\} {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$ is the spatial displacement between the two \$n\$-dimensional points. This establishes a direct link between space and the similarity of SSPs, which in turn helps bolster a useful mathematical framework for architecting neural networks that manipulate spatial structures.},

When an inference rule is selected, it commands the thalamus to modify and transmit information between areas of the cortex.

However, efforts to explain behavior in terms of EF have been hampered by an inadequate characterization of EF itself. What is the function that is accomplished by EF? The present analysis attempts to ground the construct of EF in an account of problem solving and thereby to integrate temporally and functionally distinct aspects of EF within a coherent framework. According to this problem-solving framework, EF is a macroconstruct that spans 4 phases of problem solving (representation, planning, execution, and evaluation). When analyzed into subfunctions, macroconstructs such as EF permit the integration of findings from disparate content domains, which are often studied in isolation from the broader context of reasoning and action. A review of the literature on the early development of EF reveals converging evidence for domain-general changes in all aspects of EF.},

In this article we provide an overview of a waiting experiment, recently conducted with the specific aim of testing a Vygotskian model of the emergence of volitional action. While confirming this model, the findings suggest two extensions to it. One extension is the inclusion of participants' life activity. The second extension, closely related to the first one, points at fluid and iterative movements that may occur between and within the phases of the model, due to the interference of life activity and conformity to the experimental setup.},

We first introduce the revolutionary roots of the theory in the works of Marx and Vygotsky, and the evolution of the unit of analysis through different generations of activity theory. We then discuss the foundational role of historicity and dialectics in activity theory. We identify two central epistemological-methodological principles that guide activity-theoretical studies, namely the principle of double stimulation and the principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete. These principles lead us to emphasize formative interventions as a powerful way to conduct societally impactful activity-theoretical research. We conclude by pointing out some major challenges facing activity theory in the 21st century.

            Статья посвящена основным идеям культурно-исторической теории деятельности и вызовам нового времени, встающим перед ней. Особое внимание уделяется работе так называемой Хельсинской школы теории деятельности. В первой части статьи мы описываем революционные идеи, лежащие в основе теории и уходящие корнями в работы Маркса и Выготского, а также рассматриваем, как менялись представления о единице анализа на разных этапах становления теории деятельности. Затем мы переходим к обсуждению основополагающей роли историчности и диалектичности в развитии теории деятельности, описываем два ключевых методологических и эпистемологических принципа деятельностных исследований — принцип двойной стимуляции и принцип восхождения от общего к частному. Опора на эти принципы дает нам возможность утверждать, что формирующие интервенции — мощный инструмент в реализации социально значимых, эффективных деятельностных исследований. В заключительной части статьи мы рассматриваем основные вызовы, с которыми придется столкнуться теории деятельности в XXI веке.},

Né d’un constat, celui des difficultés et des obstacles quotidiens que rencontre la communauté scientifique, l’Open science tente d’apporter des solutions aux failles du système de recherche actuel. Si l’Open science s’inscrit donc dans un contexte bien précis et actuel, il ne s’agit pas, cependant, d’un phénomène nouveau. Les notions de patrimoine, de dissémination du savoir et de communauté scientifique sont anciennes. Toutefois, ce phénomène connaît une résurgence certaine grâce au développement des technologies d’information et de communication (TIC). Le numérique permet en effet de faire émerger de nouvelles possibilités en terme de communication, d’échanges entre les chercheur•es•s et de créer de nouveaux modèles de recherche collective et collaborative inclusifs. Ainsi, quelles sont les différentes formes de l’Open science ? Qui sont ses acteurs? Dans quel contexte ce mouvement est-il apparu ? Dans quelle mesure ce phénomène nous éclaire-t-il sur l’évolution du concept de science ? Dans une perspective historique, le mouvement actuel de l’Open science représente-t-il une rupture ou bien une continuité ?},

The intuition behind it is to evaluate the credibility of OWL 2 axioms based on the evidence available in the form of a set of facts contained in a chosen RDF dataset. To achieve it, we first define the notions of development, content, support , confirmation and counterexample of an axiom. Then we use these notions to define the possibility and necessity of an axiom and its acceptance/rejection index combining both of them. Finally, we report a practical application of the proposed framework to test SubClassOf axioms against the DBpedia RDF dataset.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are a powerful modeling tool for domains where data can be naturally interpreted in terms of complex numbers. However, several analytical properties of the complex domain (e.g., holomorphicity) make the design of CVNNs a more challenging task than their real counterpart. In this paper, we consider the problem of flexible activation functions (AFs) in the complex domain, i.e., AFs endowed with sufficient degrees of freedom to adapt their shape given the training data. While this problem has received considerable attention in the real case, a very limited literature exists for CVNNs, where most activation functions are generally developed in a split fashion (i.e., by considering the real and imaginary parts of the activation separately) or with simple phase-amplitude techniques. Leveraging over the recently proposed kernel activation functions (KAFs), and related advances in the design of complex-valued kernels, we propose the first fully complex, non-parametric activation function for CVNNs, which is based on a kernel expansion with a fixed dictionary that can be implemented efficiently on vectorized hardware. Several experiments on common use cases, including prediction and channel equalization, validate our proposal when compared to real-valued neural networks and CVNNs with fixed activation functions.},

Possibility theory lies at the crossroads between fuzzy sets, probability, and nonmonotonic reasoning. Possibility theory can be cast either in an ordinal or in a numerical setting. Qualitative possibility theory is closely related to belief revision theory, and commonsense reasoning with exception-tainted knowledge in artificial intelligence. Possibilistic logic provides a rich representation setting, which enables the handling of lower bounds of possibility theory measures, while remaining close to classical logic. Qualitative possibility theory has been axiomatically justified in a decision-theoretic framework in the style of Savage, thus providing a foundation for qualitative decision theory. Quantitative possibility theory is the simplest framework for statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities. As such, it has close connections with random set theory and confidence intervals, and can provide a tool for uncertainty propagation with limited statistical or subjective information.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the cutting edge model for supervised machine learning in computer vision. In recent years CNNs have outperformed traditional approaches in many computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification and face recognition. CNNs are vulnerable to overfitting, and a lot of research focuses on finding regularization methods to overcome it. One approach is designing task specific models based on prior knowledge. Several works have shown that properties of natural images can be easily captured using complex numbers. Motivated by these works, we present a variation of the CNN model with complex valued input and weights. We construct the complex model as a generalization of the real model. Lack of order over the complex field raises several difficulties both in the definition and in the training of the network. We address these issues and suggest possible solutions. The resulting model is shown to be a restricted form of a real valued CNN with twice the parameters. It is sensitive to phase structure, and we suggest it serves as a regularized model for problems where such structure is important. This suggestion is verified empirically by comparing the performance of a complex and a real network in the problem of cell detection. The two networks achieve comparable results, and although the complex model is hard to train, it is significantly less vulnerable to overfitting. We also demonstrate that the complex network detects meaningful phase structure in the data.},

This process takes a noisy approximation of a state and recovers the original information. As a particular example, we consider the cleanup required for the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures, which provide a method for manipulating symbols using a ﬁxed-length vector representation. To recognize the result of these manipulations, a mechanism for cleaning up the resulting noisy representation is needed, as this noise increases with the number of symbols being combined. While these symbolic manipulations have previously been modelled with biologically plausible neurons, this paper presents the ﬁrst spiking neuron model of the cleanup process. We demonstrate that it approaches ideal performance and that the neural requirements scale linearly with the number of distinct symbols in the system. While this result is relevant for any biological model requiring cleanup, it is crucial for VSAs, as it completes the set of mechanisms needed to provide a full neural implementation of symbolic reasoning.},

	abstract = {Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) combine a high-dimensional vector space with a set of carefully designed operators in order to perform symbolic computations with large numerical vectors. Major goals are the exploitation of their representational power and ability to deal with fuzziness and ambiguity. Over the past years, VSAs have been applied to a broad range of tasks and several VSA implementations have been proposed. The available implementations differ in the underlying vector space (e.g., binary vectors or complex-valued vectors) and the particular implementations of the required VSA operators – with important ramiﬁcations for the properties of these architectures. For example, not every VSA is equally well suited to address each task, including complete incompatibility. This paper provides an overview of eleven available VSA implementations and discusses their commonalities and differences in the underlying vector space, bundling, and binding/unbinding operations. We create a taxonomy of available binding/unbinding operations and show an important ramiﬁcation for non self-inverse binding operations using an example from analogical reasoning. A main contribution is the experimental comparison of the available implementations in order to evaluate (1) the capacity of bundles, (2) the approximation quality of non-exact unbinding operations, (3) the inﬂuence of combining binding and bundling operations on the query answering performance, and (4) the performance on two example applications: visual place recognition and language recognition. An overall good performance is shown by the Holographic Reduced Representations VSA in the frequency domain (FHRR). However, its non-self-inverse binding mechanism can negatively inﬂuence its applicability, e.g. to analogical reasoning. Self-inverting VSAs like MAP or BSC are better suited for such applications. We expect this systematization and comparison to be relevant for development and evaluation of new VSAs, but most importantly, to support the selection of an appropriate VSA for a particular task. The implementations are available in form of a MATLAB toolbox to simplify testing different VSAs for new applications.},

	abstract = {One goal of researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence is to build theoretical models that are able to explain the flexibility and adaptiveness of biological systems. How to build a brain provides a detailed guided exploration of a new cognitive architecture that takes biological detail seriously, while addressing cognitive phenomena. The Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) introduced in this book provides a set of tools for constructing a wide range of biologically constrained perceptual, cognitive, and motor models. Examples of such models are provided, and they are shown to explain a wide range of data including single cell recordings, neural population activity, reaction times, error rates, choice behavior, and fMRI signals. Each of these models introduces a major feature of biological cognition addressed in the book, including semantics, syntax, control, learning, and memory. These models are not introduced as independent considerations of brain function, but instead integrated to give rise to what is currently the world's largest functional brain model. The last half of this book compares the Semantic Pointer Architecture with the current state-of-the-art, addressing issues of theory construction in the behavioral sciences, semantic compositionality, and scalability, among other considerations. The book concludes with a discussion of conceptual challenges raised by this architecture, and identifies several outstanding challenges for this, and other, cognitive architectures. Along the way, the book considers neural coding, concept representation, neural dynamics, working memory, neuroanatomy, reinforcement learning, and spike-timing dependent plasticity. The book includes 8 detailed, hands-on tutorials exploiting the free Nengo neural simulation environment, providing practical experience with the concepts and models presented throughout.},

It is within this context that we already developed the Biomolecular Network Ontology especially for the semantic understanding of the behaviour of complex biomolecular networks and their transittability. However, the challenge now is how to automatically populate it from a variety of biological documents. To this end, the target of this paper is to propose a new approach to automatically populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology and take advantage of the vast amount of biological knowledge expressed in heterogeneous unstructured data about complex biomolecular networks. Indeed, we have recently observed the emergence of deep learning techniques that provide significant and rapid progress in several domains, particularly in the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Despite its significant progress in recent years, deep learning is still not commonly used to populate ontologies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based NLP ontology population system to populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology. Its originality is to jointly exploit deep learning and natural language processing techniques to identify, extract and classify new instances referring to the BNO ontology’s concepts from textual data. The preliminary results highlight the efficiency of our proposal for ontology population.},

Our methods do not involve such optimization techniques as back--propagation, while assuring optimal (a priori) error bounds on the output in terms of the number of derivatives of the target function. In addition, these methods are universal, in that they do not require a prior knowledge of the smoothness of the target function, but adjust the accuracy of approximation locally and automatically, depending only upon the local smoothness of the target function. Our ideas are easily extended to solve both the pre--image problem and the out--of--sample extension problem, with a priori bounds on the growth of the function thus extended.},

He contended that typical connectionist approaches fail to meet these challenges and that the dialogue between linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience will be relatively unproductive until the importance of these problems is widely recognised and the challenges answered by some technical innovation in connectionist modelling.

We propose two ontology-based neural network architectures for sound event classiﬁcation. We deﬁned a framework to design simple network architectures that preserve an ontological structure.

	abstract = {Cette thèse propose de construire un cadre de travail de modélisation systémique, pour aider à la compréhension de l'organisation des systèmes associant le cortex préfrontal (PFC) et les ganglions de la base (BG) et de leurs interactions fonctionnelles dans les processus de prise de décision et de comportement dirigé par les buts chez les humains. Un environnement de jeu vidéo, Minecraft, est utilisé pour concevoir des expériences. Elles visent à tester le jeu vidéo dans un environnement qui pourrait être plus complexe et réaliste, si besoin. Ce cadre, avec l'expérimentation virtuelle, forme une architecture en boucle fermée pour l'étude de comportements animaux de haut niveau. Le cadre des systèmes neuronaux de ce travail repose sur la dynamique des réseaux entre des sous-systèmes du PFC et des BG. Le PFC joue un rôle crucial dans les fonctions exécutives comme la planification, l'attention, le comportement dirigé par les buts, etc. Les BG sont un groupe de noyaux sous-corticaux qui ont fait l'objet d'études approfondies dans le domaine du contrôle moteur et de la sélection de l'action. Différentes régions dans le PFC et les structures au sein des BG sont organisées anatomiquement, en boucles parallèles et séparées (chacune d'entre elles étant appelée une boucle CBG). Ces boucles peuvent être, à un niveau abstrait, divisées en 3 types : les boucles limbiques, les boucles associatives et les boucles sensorimotrices. Tout d'abord, un cadre global avec ces boucles parallèles a été mis en oeuvre. L'accent est mis sur les boucles limbiques. Les boucles associatives et sensori-motrices sont modélisées de manière algorithmique, à l'aide de la plate-forme d'expérimentation pour le contrôle moteur. Pour ce qui concerne les boucles limbiques, le cortex orbitofrontal (OFC) représente une boucle pour estimer les préférences et la boucle du cortex cingulaire antérieur (ACC) représente les besoins internes. Le substrat correspondant de ces boucles dans les BG est le striatum ventral (VS), beaucoup étudié pour son rôle dans le codage des valeurs. Des scénarios simples sont conçus dans l'environnement virtuel en utilisant l'agent, certains objets et des récompenses appétitives dans l'environnement. Les boucles limbiques ont été implémentées selon des modèles existants de prise de décision dans les BG. Ainsi, le cadre théorique et la plateforme expérimentale servent de banc d'essai pour ces modèles spécifiques qui doivent s'adapter dans une perspective plus large. Ensuite, nous utilisons ce cadre pour étudier de plus près le rôle de l’OFC dans la prise de décision guidée par la valeur et le comportement dirigé par les buts. Dans le cadre de cette thèse, des observations importantes sur le rôle de l’OFC dans le comportement ont été intégrées en consolidant de nombreuses données expérimentales. [...]},

Modality-specific ‘embodied’ mechanisms anchored in sensorimotor systems appear to be relevant, as are ‘disembodied’ mechanisms in multimodal areas. In this paper, four semantic mechanisms are proposed and spelt out at the level of neuronal circuits: referential semantics, which establishes links between symbols and the objects and actions they are used to speak about; combinatorial semantics, which enables the learning of symbolic meaning from context; emotional-affective semantics, which establishes links between signs and internal states of the body; and abstraction mechanisms for generalizing over a range of instances of semantic meaning. Referential, combinatorial, emotional-affective, and abstract semantics are complementary mechanisms, each necessary for processing meaning in mind and brain.},

In this paper, we extend the VSA approach and apply it to decentralized workflows, capable of executing distributed compute nodes and their interdependencies. To achieve this goal, services must be discovered and orchestrated in a decentralized way with the minimum communication overhead whilst providing detailed information about the workflow - tasks, dependencies, location, metadata, and so on. To this end, we extended VSAs using a hierarchical vector chunking scheme that enables semantic matching at each level and provides scaling up to tens of thousands of services. We then show how VSAs can be used to encode complex workflows  by building primitives that represent sequences (pipelines) and then extend this to support full Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and apply this to five well-known Pegasus scientific workflows to demonstrate the approach},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have proved very successful on archetypal tasks for which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce, their performance suffers from overfitting. Many existing methods of reducing overfitting are data-independent, and their efficacy is often limited when the training set is very small. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is typically hard to parametrize explicitly and often requires human input of tangent vectors. These methods typically only focus on the geometry of the input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, the Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are searched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method without increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate two benefits of LDMNet in the experiments. First, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms widely-used network regularizers such as weight decay and DropOut. Second, we show that LDMNet can be designed to extract common features of an object imaged via different modalities, which proves to be very useful in real-world applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.},

	title = {Learning large-scale heteroassociative memories in spiking neurons},
	doi = {10.13140/RG.2.1.1382.1688},
	abstract = {Associative memories have been an active area of research over the last forty years (Willshaw et al., 1969; Kohonen, 1972; Hopfield, 1982) because they form a central component of many cognitive architectures (Pollack, 1988; Anderson \& Lebiere, 1998). We focus specifically on associative memories that store associations between arbitrary pairs of neural states. When a noisy version of an input state vector is presented to the network, it must output a ”clean” version of the associated state vector. We describe a method for building large-scale networks for online learning of associations using spiking neurons, which works by exploiting the techniques of the Neural Engineering Framework (Eliasmith \& Anderson, 2003). This framework has previously been used by Stewart et al. (2011) to create memories that possess a number of desirable properties including high accuracy, a fast, feedforward recall process, and etcient scaling, requiring a number of neurons linear in the number of stored associations. These memories have played a central role in several recent neural cognitive models including Spaun, the world’s largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012), as well as a proposal for human-scale, biologically plausible knowledge representation (Crawford et al., 2013). However, these memories are constructed using an ne optimization method that is not biologically plausible. Here we demonstrate how a similar set of connection weights can be arrived at through a biologically plausible, online learning process featuring a novel synaptic learning rule inspired in part by the well-known Oja learning rule (Oja, 1989). We present the details of our method and report the results of simulations exploring the storage capacity of these networks. We show that our technique scales up to large numbers of associations, and that recall performance degrades gracefully as the theoretical capacity is exceeded. This work has been implemented in the Nengo simulation package (http://nengo.ca), which will allow straightforward implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. The result of our work is a fast, adaptive, scalable associative memory composed of spiking neurons which we expect to be a valuable addition to large systems peforming online neural computation.},

The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered signiﬁcant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the NEF; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the NEF is used, and for doing research that generates speciﬁc NEF models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world’s largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4’s ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a ﬂexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

	abstract = {For years, researchers have used the theoretical tools of engineering to understand neural systems, but much of this work has been conducted in relative isolation. In Neural Engineering, Chris Eliasmith and Charles Anderson provide a synthesis of the disparate approaches current in computational neuroscience, incorporating ideas from neural coding, neural computation, physiology, communications theory, control theory, dynamics, and probability theory. This synthesis, they argue, enables novel theoretical and practical insights into the functioning of neural systems. Such insights are pertinent to experimental and computational neuroscientists and to engineers, physicists, and computer scientists interested in how their quantitative tools relate to the brain.The authors present three principles of neural engineering based on the representation of signals by neural ensembles, transformations of these representations through neuronal coupling weights, and the integration of control theory and neural dynamics. Through detailed examples and in-depth discussion, they make the case that these guiding principles constitute a useful theory for generating large-scale models of neurobiological function. A software package written in MatLab for use with their methodology, as well as examples, course notes, exercises, documentation, and other material, are available on the Web.},

	abstract = {We show how to interoperate, semantically and inferentially, between the leading Semantic Web approaches to rules (RuleML Logic Programs) and ontologies (OWL/DAML+OIL Description Logic) via analyzing their expressive intersection. To do so, we define a new intermediate knowledge representation (KR) contained within this intersection: Description Logic Programs (DLP), and the closely related Description Horn Logic (DHL) which is an expressive fragment of first-order logic (FOL). DLP provides a significant degree of expressiveness, substantially greater than the RDF-Schema fragment of Description Logic. We show how to perform DLP-fusion: the bidirectional translation of premises and inferences (including typical kinds of queries) from the DLP fragment of DL to LP, and vice versa from the DLP fragment of LP to DL. In particular, this translation enables one to "build rules on top of ontologies": it enables the rule KR to have access to DL ontological definitions for vocabulary primitives (e.g., predicates and individual constants) used by the rules. Conversely, the DLP-fusion technique likewise enables one to "build ontologies on top of rules": it enables ontological definitions to be supplemented by rules, or imported into DL from rules. It also enables available efficient LP inferencing algorithms/implementations to be exploited for reasoning over large-scale DL ontologies.},

	abstract = {The brain is a complex system, due to the heterogeneity of its structure, the diversity of the functions in which it participates and to its reciprocal relationships with the body and the environment. A systemic description of the brain is presented here, as a contribution to developing a brain theory and as a general framework where specific models in computational neuroscience can be integrated and associated with global information flows and cognitive functions. In an enactive view, this framework integrates the fundamental organization of the brain in sensorimotor loops with the internal and the external worlds, answering four fundamental questions (what, why, where and how). Our survival-oriented definition of behavior gives a prominent role to pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, augmented during phylogeny by the specific contribution of other kinds of learning, related to semantic memory in the posterior cortex, episodic memory in the hippocampus and working memory in the frontal cortex. This framework highlights that responses can be prepared in different ways, from pavlovian reflexes and habitual behavior to deliberations for goal-directed planning and reasoning, and explains that these different kinds of responses coexist, collaborate and compete for the control of behavior. It also lays emphasis on the fact that cognition can be described as a dynamical system of interacting memories, some acting to provide information to others, to replace them when they are not efficient enough, or to help for their improvement. Describing the brain as an architecture of learning systems has also strong implications in Machine Learning. Our biologically informed view of pavlovian and instrumental conditioning can be very precious to revisit classical Reinforcement Learning and provide a basis to ensure really autonomous learning.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration is a key enabler of autonomous lifelong learning in human children. It enables the discovery and acquisition of large repertoires of skills through self-generation, self-selection, self-ordering and self-experimentation of learning goals. We present an algorithmic approach called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP) to enable similar properties of autonomous or self-supervised learning in machines. The IMGEP algorithmic architecture relies on several principles: 1) self-generation of goals, generalized as ﬁtness functions; 2) selection of goals based on intrinsic rewards; 3) exploration with incremental goal-parameterized policy search and exploitation of the gathered data with a batch learning algorithm; 4) systematic reuse of information acquired when targeting a goal for improving towards other goals. We present a particularly efﬁcient form of IMGEP, called Modular Population-Based IMGEP, that uses a population-based policy and an object-centered modularity in goals and mutations. We provide several implementations of this architecture and demonstrate their ability to automatically generate a learning curriculum within several experimental setups including a real humanoid robot that can explore multiple spaces of goals with several hundred continuous dimensions. While no particular target goal is provided to the system, this curriculum allows the discovery of skills that act as stepping stone for learning more complex skills, e.g. nested tool use. We show that learning diverse spaces of goals with intrinsic motivations is more efﬁcient for learning complex skills than only trying to directly learn these complex skills.},

	url = {https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/13498},
	abstract = {I present the context-unified encoding (CUE) model, a large-scale spiking neural network model of human memory. 
It combines and integrates activity-based short-term memory with weight-based long-term memory. 
The implementation with spiking neurons ensures biological plausibility and allows for predictions on the neural level. 
At the same time, the model produces behavioural outputs that have been matched to human data from serial and free recall experiments. 
In particular, well-known results such as primacy, recency, transposition error gradients, and forward recall bias have been reproduced with good quantitative matches. 
Additionally, the model accounts for the effects of the acetylcholine antagonist scopolamine, and the Hebb repetition effect. 
 
The CUE model combines and extends the ordinal serial encoding (OSE) model, a spiking neuron model of short-term memory, and the temporal context model (TCM), a mathematical model of free recall. 
To the former, a neural mechanism for tracking the list position is added. 
The latter is converted into a spiking neural network under considerations of the main features and simplification of equations where appropriate. 
Previous models of the recall process in the TCM are replaced by a new independent accumulator recall process that is more suited to the integration into a large-scale network. 
To implement the modification of the required association matrices, a novel learning rule, the association matrix learning rule (AML), is derived that allows for one-shot learning without catastrophic forgetting. 
Its biological plausibility is discussed and it is shown that it accounts for changes in neural firing observed in human recordings from an association learning experiment. 
Furthermore, I discuss a recent proposal of an optimal fuzzy temporal memory as replacement for the TCM context signal and show it to be likely to require more neurons than there are in the human brain. 
 
To construct the CUE model, I have used the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA). 
This thesis makes novel contributions to both. 
I propose to distribute NEF intercepts according to the distribution of cosine similarities of random uniformly distributed unit vectors. 
This leads to a uniform distribution of active neurons and reduces the error introduced by spiking noise considerably in high-dimensional neuronal representations. 
It improves the asymptotic scaling of the noise error with dimensions d from O(d) to O(d{\textasciicircum}(3/4))\$. 
These results are applied to achieve improved Semantic Pointer representations in neural networks are on par with or better than previous methods of optimizing neural representations for the Semantic Pointer Architecture. 
Furthermore, the vector-derived transformation binding (VTB) is investigated as an alternative to circular convolution in the SPA, with promising results.},

	shorttitle = {Spaun 2.0},
	url = {https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/13308},
	abstract = {Building large-scale brain models is one method used by theoretical neuroscientists to understand the way the human brain functions. Researchers typically use either a bottom-up approach, which focuses on the detailed modelling of various biological properties of the brain and places less importance on reproducing functional behaviour, or a top-down approach, which generally aim to reproduce the behaviour observed in real cognitive agents, but typically sacrifices adherence to constraints imposed by the neuro-biology. The focus of this thesis is Spaun, a large-scale brain model constructed using a combination of the bottom-up and top-down approaches to brain modelling. Spaun is currently the world’s largest functional brain model, capable of performing eight distinct cognitive tasks ranging from digit recognition to inductive reasoning. The thesis is organized to discuss three aspects of the Spaun model. First, it describes the original Spaun model, and explores how a top-down approach, known as the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), has been combined with a bottom-up approach, known as the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), to integrate six existing cognitive models into a unified cognitive model that is Spaun. Next, the thesis identifies some of the concerns with the original Spaun model, and show the modifications made to the network to remedy these issues. It also characterizes how the Spaun model was re-organized and re-implemented (to include the aforementioned modifications) as the Spaun 2.0 model. As part of the discussion of the Spaun 2.0 model, task performance results are presented that compare the original Spaun model and the re-implemented Spaun 2.0 model, demonstrating that the modifications to the Spaun 2.0 model have improved its accuracy on the working memory task, and the two induction tasks. Finally, three extensions to Spaun 2.0 are presented. These extensions take advantage of the re-organized Spaun model, giving Spaun 2.0 new capabilities – a motor system capable of adapting to unknown force fields applied to its arm; a visual system capable of processing 256×256 full-colour images; and the ability to follow general instructions. The Spaun model and architecture presented in this thesis demonstrate that by using the SPA and the NEF, it is not only possible to construct functional large-scale brain models, but to do so in a manner that supports complex extensions to the model. The final Spaun 2.0 model consists of approximately 6.6 million neurons, can perform 12 cognitive tasks, and has been demonstrated to reproduce behavioural and neurological data observed in natural cognitive agents.},

We define semantic extensions of RDFS that involve datatypes and a subset of the OWL vocabulary that includes the property-related vocabulary (e.g. Functional- Property), the comparisons (e.g. sameAs and differentFrom) and the value restrictions (e.g. allValuesFrom). These semantic extensions are in line with the 'if-semantics' of RDFS and weaker than the 'iff-semantics' of D-entailment and OWL (DL or Full). For these semantic extensions we present entailment rules, prove completeness results, prove that consistency is in P and that, just as for RDFS, entailment is NP-complete, and in P if the target graph does not contain blank nodes. There are no restrictions on use to obtain decidability: classes can be used as instances.},

	abstract = {We propose a modular reinforcement learning architecture for nonlinear, nonstationary control tasks, which we call multiple model-based reinforcement learning (MMRL). The basic idea is to decompose a complex task into multiple domains in space and time based on the predictability of the environmental dynamics. The system is composed of multiple modules, each of which consists of a state prediction model and a reinforcement learning controller. The “responsibility signal,” which is given by the softmax function of the prediction errors, is used to weight the outputs of multiple modules, as well as to gate the learning of the prediction models and the reinforcement learning controllers. We formulate MMRL for both discrete-time, finite-state case and continuous-time, continuous-state case. The performance of MMRL was demonstrated for discrete case in a nonstationary hunting task in a grid world and for continuous case in a nonlinear, nonstationary control task of swinging up a pendulum with variable physical parameters.},

	abstract = {The successor representation (SR) is a candidate principle for generalization in reinforcement learning, computational accounts of memory, and the structure of neural representations in the hippocampus. Given a sequence of states, the SR learns a predictive representation for every given state that encodes how often, on average, each upcoming state is expected to be visited, even if it is multiple steps ahead. A discount or scale parameter determines how many steps into the future SR’s generalizations reach, enabling rapid value computation, subgoal discovery, and ﬂexible decision-making in large trees. However, SR with a single scale could discard information for predicting both the sequential order of and the distance between states, which are common problems in navigation for animals and artiﬁcial agents. Here we propose a solution: an ensemble of SRs with multiple scales. We show that the derivative of multi-scale SR can reconstruct both the sequence of expected future states and estimate distance to goal. This derivative can be computed linearly: we show that a multi-scale SR ensemble is the Laplace transform of future states, and the inverse of this Laplace transform is a biologically plausible linear estimation of the derivative. Multi-scale SR and its derivative could lead to a common principle for how the medial temporal lobe supports both map-based and vector-based navigation.},

Intro
1) Limitation: Markov property
={\textgreater} the optimal action to take in a particular observed state must depend only on that state and not on the recent history of the agent
Workaround: order-n Markov chains, ie an agent’s state = the set of its n most recent observations (or only the most relevant of them)
But still a finite number
2) WM vs EM
Working memory: ‘‘active and relevant only for a short period of time’’
Episodic memory: longer lasting memory that allows one to recall and re-experience personal events
Implementation in RL: memory part of the environment
={\textgreater} the agent can act upon it

Methods
Notations
table of values V, V(s) = expected discounted reward following state s
table of actions Q, Q(s,a) = value of taking action a in state s
SL sensory states
motor actions N/S/E/W change SL
Working memory
WM = the ability to maintain a representation of a stimulus online and to be able to manipulate it mentally
+1 action "add current sensory state to buffer"
+1 state for empty WM
Episodic memory
EM:
- addressable content
= can be elicited from a cue that is contained as part of the memory
- temporally indexed
= one can ‘‘replay’’ the memory from a retrieved point ( =/= semantic memory)
SEQ: sequence of n most recent states
+ 2 actions:
cue retrieval (Sep {\textless}- SL)
advance retrieval (Sep {\textless}- next state in SEQ)
+ 1 state for empty EM "nothing recalled"
WM can buffer episodic retrieval
Rewards and Limitations on Actions
- for actions that don't change the agent’s state or moving backwards: reward R = -1. Includes
- attempting to move out of the environment or into a barrier
- store something in WM that is already stored
- to advance episodic retrieval without first cuing retrieval
- moving backward
Most tasks:
- correct move: R = +9.5
- incorrect move: R = -6
- other actions: R = +0.05
limit of 100 on the number of steps
Odor sequence disambiguation:
- correct move: R = +1
- incorrect move: R = -5
- other actions: R = +0.05

Results
Task 1: Spatial Sequence Disambiguation (SSD)
I-shape maze
start from the bottom of an arm, end up in the opposite top arm
repositioned at a random start bottom arm for the next trial
delayed task: clear WM when repositioning
both the episodic and WM agents were able to solve the nondelayed task, whereas only the episodic agent could solve the delayed version
the standard agent could not learn the task in either version
Task 2: Spatial Alternation
M-shaped maze
begin at the bottom of the center hallway in the maze and proceed up to the choice point.
First trial:
- turn either left or right and received a positive reward at the end of the arm
- continue along a return arm and back to the starting point
- proceed again up the center hallway to the choice point (at the starting point, the agent was prevented from entering the side hallway instead of the center hallwayby use of a barrier).
After the first trial:
positive reward if opposite direction as on the previous trial,negative otherwise
Delayed version: WM cleared on every visit to the start position (bottom of the stem)
Same result as before: WM and WM+EP work for nondelayed, WM+EP for delayed
Task 3: Nonmatch to Position
same principle, same results
Task 4: Nonmatch to Sample
- sample stage in which only one of the two levers was available for making a response, - then a choice stage in which both levers were available.
Negative reward if actioning the same lever (as available during the sample), positive reward for the other lever
After making a response at a lever, the animal was moved back to the starting position
WM cleared before the sample stage
Delayed version: WM also cleared before the choice stage
In principle, both versions of this task were solvable using EM; however, the nondelayed version was more readily solved using only WM
Task 5: Odor Sequence Disambiguation
linear track with five pairs of odors
On each trial, select one odor of each pair.
Positive reward if right odor, negative otherwise
Correction before advancing to the next pair, except for the final pair
Delayed version: WM cleared before the final pair
Same results as task 4:
WM performs better for nondelayed task
WM only cannot solve delayed task
the simulation was not run long enough to show the agents with EM learning to correctly perform the task
Task 6: Tone-Cued Spatial Alternation
same as task 2 with sounds
each time a tone is presented, the agent has to make the opposite response as on the previous presentation (2 independant tones)
={\textgreater} best use-case for EM (remember the sound: cue retrieval)
non-delayed task: WM can use a simple alernation strategy
both tasks: EM performs better
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Discussion
WM: if a task can be solved based on which of a set of states was most recently experienced
EM: if a task can be solved based on the states that previously followed some given experienced state on the current trial

	title = {Guiding policies with language via meta-learning},
	abstract = {Behavioral skills or policies for autonomous agents are conventionally learned from reward functions, via reinforcement learning, or from demonstrations, via imitation learning. However, both modes of task speciﬁcation have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufﬁcient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufﬁcient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task speciﬁcation problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.},

Given such a formal description, either tractability or intractability of the problem is established, by proving that the problem either enjoys a polynomial time algorithm or is NP-hard.

We propose ontology-based deep restricted Boltzmann machine (OB-DRBM), in which we use ontology to guide architecture design of deep restricted Boltzmann machines (DRBM), as well as to assist in their training and validation processes. Our model learns a set of related semantic-rich data representations from both formal semantics and data distribution. Representations in this set correspond to concepts at various semantic levels in a domain ontology. We show that our model leads to an improved performance, when compared with conventional deep learning models in classiﬁcation tasks.},

Hypervectors provide powerful and noise-robust representations and VSAs are associated with promising theoretical properties for approaching high-level cognitive tasks. However, a major drawback of VSAs is the lack of opportunities to learn them from training data. Their power is merely an effect of good (and elaborate) design rather than learning. We exploit highlevel knowledge about the structure of reactive robot problems to learn a VSA based on training data. We demonstrate preliminary results on a simple navigation task. Given a successful demonstration of a navigation run by pairs of sensor input and actuator output, the system learns a single hypervector that encodes this reactive behaviour. When executing (and combining) such VSA-based behaviours, the advantages of hypervectors (i.e. the representational power and robustness to noise) are preserved. Moreover, a particular beauty of this approach is that it can learn encodings for behaviours that have exactly the same form (a hypervector) no matter how complex the sensor input or the behaviours are.},

In this paper we exploit such advances by tailoring the ontology learning problem as a transductive reasoning task that learns to convert knowledge from natural language to a logic-based specification. More precisely, using a sample of definitory sentences generated starting by a synthetic grammar, we trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures to extract OWL formulae from text. In addition to the low feature engineering costs, our system shows good generalisation capabilities over the lexicon and the syntactic structure. The encouraging results obtained in the paper provide a first evidence of the potential of deep learning techniques towards long term ontology learning challenges such as improving domain independence, reducing engineering costs, and dealing with variable language forms.},

	abstract = {: MIX is an ESPRIT project aimed at developing strategies and tools for integrating symbolic and neural methods in hybrid systems. The project arose from the observation that current hybrid systems are generally small-scale experimental systems which couple one symbolic and one connectionist model, often in an ad hoc fashion. Hence the objective of building a versatile testbed for the design, prototyping and assessment of a variety of hybrid models or architectures, in particular those which combine diverse neural network models with rule/model-based, cased-based, and fuzzy reasoning. A multiagent approach has been chosen to facilitate modular implementation of these hybrid models, which will be tested in the context of real-world applications in the steel and automobile industries. 1.

Over the past several years, we have developed a computational thinking framework that emerged from our studies of the activities of interactive media designers.

This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4\% for CT level and 61.2\% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. The findings contribute to a better understanding of CT as a construct and have implications for CT instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in CT learning.},

Cet apprentissage vise notamment le développement de la pensée informatique (au sens défini par Wing) afin de permettre aux élèves, filles et garçons, d'acquérir les bases, une étape initiale vers la maîtrise du numérique, sous tous ses aspects (science, technologie, industrie et culture). Cependant, peu d'enseignant·e·s, ou de parents, ont été formé·e·s pour enseigner les sciences du numérique ou éduquer à leurs fondements et leurs usages. De plus, si le système éducatif avance progressivement au niveau de ces objectifs, dans la vie quotidienne et en contexte professionnel, il existe aussi un besoin de formation tout au long de la vie à la pensée informatique. Des projets d'envergure sur l'apprentissage du code sont aujourd'hui forts d'un véritable succès en matière de support à la formation des professionnel·le·s de l'éducation sur ces sujets. Cependant ces projets nécessitent une main d'oeuvre importante tant pour la création de ressources que pour leur actualisation, afin de rester en phase avec les besoins de formation dans un domaine en évolution constante.

In this study, we engage undergraduate students in a creative programming activity using Scratch. Then, we analyze the computational thinking scores of an automatic analysis tool and the human assessment of the creative programming projects.

Historical, philosophical, and pedagogical aspects. What are the big ideas of CS we must teach? What are the historical and pedagogical contexts in which CT emerged, and why are relevant? What is the relationship between learning theories (e.g., constructivism) and teaching approaches (e.g., plugged and unplugged)? 2. Cognitive aspects. What is the sentiment of generalist teachers not trained to teach CS? What misconceptions do they hold about concepts like CT and "coding"? 3. Affective and motivational aspects. What is the impact of personal beliefs about intelligence (mindset) and about CS ability? What the role of teaching approaches? This research has been conducted both through historical and philosophical argumentation, and through quantitative and qualitative studies (both on nationwide samples and small significant ones), in particular through the lens of (often exaggerated) claims about transfer from CS to other skills. Four important claims are substantiated. 1. CS should be introduced in K-12 as a tool to understand and act in our digital world, and to use the power of computation for meaningful learning. CT is the conceptual sediment of that learning. We designed a curriculum proposal in this direction. 2. The expressions CT (useful to distantiate from digital literacy) and "coding" can cause misconceptions among teachers, who focus mainly on transfer to general thinking skills. Both disciplinary and pedagogical teacher training is hence needed. 3. Some plugged and unplugged teaching tools have intrinsic constructivist characteristics that can facilitate CS learning, as shown with proposed activities. 4. Growth mindset is not automatically fostered by CS, while not studying CS can foster fixed beliefs. Growth mindset can be fostered by creative computing, leveraging on its constructivist aspects.},

	abstract = {In the last years, temporal differences methods have been put forward as convenient tools for reinforcement learning. Techniques based on temporal differences, however, suffer from a serious drawback: as stochastic adaptive algorithms, they may need extensive exploration of the state-action space before convergence is achieved. Although the basic methods are now reasonably well understood, it is precisely the structural simplicity of the reinforcement learning principle – learning through experimentation – that causes these excessive demands on the learning agent. Additionally, one must consider that the agent is very rarely a tabula rasa: some rough knowledge about characteristics of the surrounding environment is often available. In this paper, I present methods for embedding a priori knowledge in a reinforcement learning technique in such a way that both the mathematical structure of the basic learning algorithm and the capacity to generalise experience across the state-action space are kept. Extensive experimental results show that the resulting variants may lead to good performance, provided a sensible balance between risky use of prior imprecise knowledge and cautious use of learning experience is adopted.},

A special focus is given to the possibility of a neural implementation by the means of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF). While the scaling of required neural resources is slightly worse for VTB, it is found to be on par with circular convolution for list encoding and better for encoding of stacks. Furthermore, VTB influences the vector length less, which also benefits a neural implementation. Consequently, we argue that VTB is an improvement over HRRs for neurally implemented VSAs.},

	abstract = {Recent applications of autonomous agents and robots, such as self-driving cars, scenario-based trainers, exploration robots, and service robots have brought attention to crucial trust-related challenges associated with the current generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems based on the connectionist deep learning neural network approach lack capabilities of explaining their decisions and actions to others, despite their great successes. Without symbolic interpretation capabilities, they are black boxes, which renders their decisions or actions opaque, making it difficult to trust them in safety-critical applications. The recent stance on the explainability of AI systems has witnessed several approaches on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); however, most of the studies have focused on data-driven XAI systems applied in computational sciences. Studies addressing the increasingly pervasive goal-driven agents and robots are still missing. This paper reviews approaches on explainable goal-driven intelligent agents and robots, focusing on techniques for explaining and communicating agents perceptual functions (example, senses, and vision) and cognitive reasoning (example, beliefs, desires, intention, plans, and goals) with humans in the loop. The review highlights key strategies that emphasize transparency, understandability, and continual learning for explainability. Finally, the paper presents requirements for explainability and suggests a roadmap for the possible realization of effective goal-driven explainable agents and robots.},

	abstract = {Ontology alignment (or matching) is the operation that takes two ontologies and produces a set of semantic correspondences (usually semantic similarities) between some elements of one of them and some elements of the other. A rigorous, efficient and scalable similarity measure is a pre-requisite of an ontology alignment process. This paper presents a semantic similarity measure based on a matrix represention of nodes from an RDF labelled directed graph. An entity is described with respect to how it relates to other entities using N-dimensional vectors, being N the number of selected external predicates. We adapt a known graph matching algorithm when applying this idea to the alignment of two ontologies. We have successfully tested the model with the public testcases of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative 2005.},

	abstract = {Human behavior modeling is a key component in application domains such as healthcare and social behavior research. In addition to accurate prediction, having the capacity to understand the roles of human behavior determinants and to provide explanations for the predicted behaviors is also important. Having this capacity increases trust in the systems and the likelihood that the systems actually will be adopted, thus driving engagement and loyalty. However, most prediction models do not provide explanations for the behaviors they predict. In this paper, we study the research problem, human behavior prediction with explanations, for healthcare intervention systems in health social networks. We propose an ontology-based deep learning model (ORBM+) for human behavior prediction over undirected and nodes-attributed graphs. We first propose a bottom-up algorithm to learn the user representation from health ontologies. Then the user representation is utilized to incorporate self-motivation, social influences, and environmental events together in a human behavior prediction model, which extends a well-known deep learning method, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. ORBM+ not only predicts human behaviors accurately, but also, it generates explanations for each predicted behavior. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic health social networks have shown the tremendous effectiveness of our approach compared with conventional methods.},

	abstract = {The ability to conduct logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of intelligent human behavior, and thus an important problem along the way to human-level artificial intelligence. Traditionally, logic-based symbolic methods from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents with capabilities that resemble human logical reasoning qualities. More recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in using machine learning rather than logic-based symbolic formalisms to tackle these tasks. In this paper, we employ state-of-the-art methods for training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is able to learn how to effectively perform logical reasoning in the form of basic ontology reasoning. This is an important and at the same time very natural logical reasoning task, which is why the presented approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems. We present the outcomes of several experiments, which show that our model is able to learn to perform highly accurate ontology reasoning on very large, diverse, and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, it turned out that the suggested approach suffers much less from different obstacles that prohibit logic-based symbolic reasoning, and, at the same time, is surprisingly plausible from a biological point of view.},

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100\% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70\% and DQN's 50\% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-of-concept, we present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system -- though just a prototype -- learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.},

	abstract = {We present Revel, a partially neural reinforcement learning (RL) framework for provably safe exploration in continuous state and action spaces. A key challenge for provably safe deep RL is that repeatedly verifying neural networks within a learning loop is computationally infeasible. We address this challenge using two policy classes: a general, neurosymbolic class with approximate gradients and a more restricted class of symbolic policies that allows efficient verification. Our learning algorithm is a mirror descent over policies: in each iteration, it safely lifts a symbolic policy into the neurosymbolic space, performs safe gradient updates to the resulting policy, and projects the updated policy into the safe symbolic subset, all without requiring explicit verification of neural networks. Our empirical results show that Revel enforces safe exploration in many scenarios in which Constrained Policy Optimization does not, and that it can discover policies that outperform those learned through prior approaches to verified exploration.},

According to a stimulus-driven explanation, goal-incompatible stimuli that are easy/difficult to control lead to the tendency to fight/flee. According to a goal-directed explanation, on the other hand, the tendency to fight/flee occurs when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing is the highest. Participants did a computer task in which they were confronted with goal-incompatible stimuli that were (a) easy to control and fighting had the highest expected utility, (b) easy to control and fleeing had the highest expected utility, and (c) difficult to control and fleeing and fighting had zero expected utility. After participants were trained to use one hand to fight and another hand to flee, they either had to choose a response or merely observe the stimuli. During the observation trials, single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex 450 ms post-stimulus onset and motorevoked potentials (MEPs) were measured from the hand muscles. Results showed that participants chose to fight/flee when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest, and that they responded late when the expected utility of both responses was low. They also showed larger MEPs for the right/left hand when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest. This result can be interpreted as support for the goal-directed account, but only if it is assumed that we were unable to override the presumed natural mapping between hand (right/left) and response (fight/flight).},

	title = {Ontology as neuronal-space manifold: towards symbolic and numerical artificial embedding},
	shorttitle = {Ontology as neuronal-space manifold},
	abstract = {Some human cognitive tasks may involve tightly interleaved logical and numerical computations. On the one hand, ontologies allow us to describe symbolic structured knowledge and perform logical inference, providing a rather natural representation of human reasoning as modeled in cognitive psychology. On the other hand, spiking neural networks are a biologically plausible implementation of processing in brain circuits, yet they process numeric vectors rather than symbolic data. Unifying these symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches is still a wide and open question, and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) provides a way to manipulate symbols embedded as numeric vectors that carry semantic information.
In this paper, as a step towards filling the symbolic/numerical gap, we propose to map an ontology onto a SPA-based architecture with a preliminary partial implementation into spiking neural networks. More specifically, we focus on ontology standards used in the semantic web such as Resource Description Framework [Schema] (RDF[S]) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We provide a detailed implementation example in the case of specific RDFS entailments based on predicate chaining. To that end, we used the neural simulator Nengo with two associative memories in interaction, the first one storing assertions and the second one storing entailment rules. Reporting interesting formal results, our embedding enjoys intrinsic properties allowing semantic reasoning through distributed numerical computing. This original preliminary work thus combines symbolic and numerical approaches for cognitive modeling, which might be useful to model some complex human tasks such as ill-defined problem-solving, involving neuronal knowledge manipulation.},

Modularity is a key requirement for collaborative ontology engineering and for distributed ontology reuse on the Web. Combining ontology modules in this context to get a global ontology is an important issue since it requires to resolves mismatches between the compared concepts. This article proposes a novel approach to automatically compose ontology modules. The proposed approach is based on concept structure comparison. The algorithm allowing to merge the ontology modules into a global ontology is detailed and similarity measures are explained. Similarity measures are computed against concept names, attributes and relationships. Experiments performed to test this algorithm are described and evaluation results are equally discussed.},

	abstract = {Ontologies are today a key part of every knowledge based system. They provide a source of shared and precisely defined terms, resulting in system interoperability by knowledge sharing and reuse. Un- fortunately, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or over- lapping parts. For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement (aligned). One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class and property names of ontologies using string- distance metrics. Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature. But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields, resulting in poor performance when applied in this new domain. In the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names which performs better on the process of ontology alignment as well as to many other field matching problems.},

However, the neural computations that are explained by RL algorithms fall short of explaining many sophisticated aspects of human learning and decision making, including the generalization of behavior to novel contexts, one-shot learning, and the synthesis of task information in complex environments. Instead, these aspects of behavior are assumed to be supported by the brain’s executive functions (EF). We review recent findings that highlight the importance of EF in instrumental learning. Specifically, we advance the theory that EF sets the stage for canonical RL computations in the brain, providing inputs that broaden their flexibility and applicability. Our theory has important implications for how to interpret RL computations in both brain and behavior.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00265},
	abstract = {Due to their capacity to encode rich structural information, labeled graphs are often used for modeling various kinds of objects such as images, molecules, and chemical compounds. If pattern recognition problems such as clustering and classification are to be solved on these domains, a (dis-)similarity measure for labeled graphs has to be defined. A widely used measure is the graph edit distance (GED), which, intuitively, is defined as the minimum amount of distortion that has to be applied to a source graph in order to transform it into a target graph. The main advantage of GED is its flexibility and sensitivity to small differences between the input graphs. Its main drawback is that it is hard to compute. In this thesis, new results and techniques for several aspects of computing GED are presented. Firstly, theoretical aspects are discussed: competing definitions of GED are harmonized, the problem of computing GED is characterized in terms of complexity, and several reductions from GED to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) are presented. Secondly, solvers for the linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE) are discussed. LSAPE is a generalization of the well-known linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), and has to be solved as a subproblem by many GED algorithms. In particular, a new solver is presented that efficiently reduces LSAPE to LSAP. Thirdly, exact algorithms for computing GED are presented in a systematic way, and improvements of existing algorithms as well as a new mixed integer programming (MIP) based approach are introduced. Fourthly, a detailed overview of heuristic algorithms that approximate GED via upper and lower bounds is provided, and eight new heuristics are described. Finally, a new easily extensible C++ library for exactly or approximately computing GED is presented.},

To facilitate this goal, in this article a new approach to student modeling is proposed that benefits from the advantages of Ontological Engineering, advancing in the pursue of a more granular and complete knowledge representation. It’s focused, mainly, on the SM cognitive diagnosis process, and we present a method providing a rich diagnosis about the student’s knowledge state – especially, about the state of learning objectives reached or not.

Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster selfregulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners’ cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two mostused features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.},

	abstract = {Sequential decision making, commonly formalized as Markov Decision Process (MDP) optimization, is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two key sections, we also discuss the potential benefits of model-based RL, like enhanced data efficiency, targeted exploration, and improved stability. Along the survey, we also draw connections to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer, and other research disciplines, like behavioural psychology. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of planning-learning combinations for MDP optimization.},

The UWP pattern is present when, in a procedure consisting of multiple study–test cycles, the mean scale JOLs underestimate the mean recall performance on Cycle 2 and beyond. Although this pattern is present both for items recalled and unrecalled on the preceding cycle, to date research has concentrated mostly on the sources of UWP for the latter type of items. In the present study, we aimed to bridge this gap. In three experiments, we examined calibration on the third of three cycles. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the typical pattern of higher recall and scale JOLs for previously recalled items than for unrecalled ones. More importantly, they also revealed that even though the UWP effect was found for items previously recalled both once and twice, its magnitude was greater for the former class of items. Experiments 2 and 3, which employed a binary betting task and a binary 0 \%/100 \% JOL task, respectively, demonstrated that people can accurately predict future recall for previously recalled items with binary decisions. In both experiments, the UWP effect was absent for both items recalled once and twice. We suggest that the sensitivity of scale JOLs, but not binary judgments, to the number of previous recall successes strengthens the claim of Hanczakowski, Zawadzka, Pasek, and Higham (Journal of Memory and Language 69:429–444, 2013) that scale JOLs reflect confidence in, rather than the subjective probability of, future recall.},

	abstract = {Semantic cognition encompasses human performance based on knowledge about the properties of objects, relations among objects and word meanings. One approach to semantic cognition has arisen within the parallel distributed processing (PDP) framework, in which cognitive processes arise from interactions of neurons through synaptic connections. The knowledge that governs processing is stored in the strengths of the connections and is acquired gradually through experience, simulating conceptual development in childhood. These ideas have been explored in a simulated neural network model that learns propositions about objects and their properties. The model is trained with propositions about several different plant and animal concepts, including trees, flowers, fish, birds and land animals. The model contains 'hidden' units between its inputs and outputs, over which it learns internal representations that capture semantic relationships between concepts. Learning is influenced by coherent covariation of properties — that is, by co-occurrence of the same ensemble of properties (has wings, has feathers, can fly) in a number of different items (in this case, all the birds). The model explains the tendency towards progressive differentiation of concepts observed in development and the reverse fine-to-coarse deterioration observed in a progressive neuropathological condition called semantic dementia. With appropriate assumptions about covariation of properties, and about the relative frequencies of concepts and of the words used to name them, the model also addresses many further findings in development, dementia and normal adult cognition. Like other, similarity-based theories, the model accounts for the influence of graded category membership on semantic task performance, and for frequency and typicality effects. It also provides a means of addressing some of the criticisms of these other theories. Specifically, it indicates how some properties of objects, including causal properties, come to be more important than other properties; why some groups of items seem to form natural or coherent categories; how domain-specific patterns of generalization and differentiation might arise; and how conceptual knowledge structures might reorganize over the course of development. The PDP approach might provide a mechanistic framework that can address many of the phenomena emphasized in an alternative approach based on naive domain theories specifying causal relations between objects and their properties. Some of the relevant phenomena have yet to be addressed by PDP models, leaving this as a task for the future.},

Recent theoretical work has provided normative accounts for why there should be more than one control system, and how the output of different controllers can be integrated. Two particlar controllers have been identiﬁed, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has experienced signiﬁcant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decisionmaking tasks. However, one challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efﬁciently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system.},

Recently, more sophisticated RL algorithms have been proposed to better account for human learning, and in particular its oft-documented reliance on two separable systems: a model-based (MB) system and a model-free (MF) system. However, along with many benefits, this dichotomous lens can distort questions, and may contribute to an unnecessarily narrow perspective on learning and decision-making. Here, we outline some of the consequences that come from overconfidently mapping algorithms, such as MB versus MF RL, with putative cognitive processes.

This framework is missing some fundamental features of the affective nervous system, most importantly, the central role of goals in driving and organizing behavior in a teleological manner. Even when goal-directed behaviors are considered in current frameworks, they are typically conceived of as arising in reaction to the environment, rather than being in place from the start. We hypothesize that goal-driven cognition is primary, and organized into two discrete phases: goal selection and goal engaged, which each have a substantially different effective value function. This dichotomy can potentially explain a wide range of phenomena, playing a central role in many clinical disorders, such as depression, OCD, ADHD, and PTSD, and providing a sensible account of the detailed biology and function of the dopamine system and larger limbic system, including critical ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Computationally, reasoning backward from active goals to action selection is more tractable than projecting alternative action choices forward to compute possible outcomes.

pre-print of Goal-Driven Cognition in the Brain: a Computational Framework OReillyHazyMollickEtAl14.pdf
Abstract: models of DA-based RL in behaviorist tradition: organism = reactive recipient of reward/punishments, behavior resulting from history. This framework misses affective nervous system, goals; teleogical view of organization of behavior. When goals are considered, arise in reaction to envt (and not internal goals). Here consider goal-driven cognition, organized in two phases: goal selection and goal engaged (each with different value function). Appli in clinical disorders; role of DA and limbic system (dont ventral et mPFC). Computationally, use reasoning backward from goals to actions more tractable than projecting actions to compute possible outcomes. Propose such a model.
Intro: Behaviorism: temporal models of causality: stimuli trigger actions leading to outcomes. Our experience: our goals (mental representations of desired states) determine actions.
In RL, S-R learning prominent: actions triggered by states of envt and lead to reinforcement and performed more frequently in similar states else attenuated: Thorndike's Law of Effect. cf also Model-free and model-based forms of RL Model-free = standard S-R-O; model-based use internal model to anticipate future outcomes in a sequence of actions: what-if analysis; new approach but becomes surprisingly quickly untractable Solway12 et teleogical approach based on goals remains more interesting.
This paper: biologically informed and constrained comput framework of cognition starting with goals. Main hypo: Y two states of mental life: goal selection and goal engaged with different value functions (because strong motivation to achieve one goal when selected). cf Pezzulo09.
Link with neuroscience of affective behavior and cognitive control: v/mPFC, including OFC, medial wall including ACC. Representation of hot goals in v/mPFC have an energizing influence on processing in the brain including on executive control in lPFC: selection and maintenance of cold goals or task set representations. Here focus on hot side.
Some principles:
Principle 1: Active goals are primary and at least one must be engaged at all times; need clear criterion for accomplishment and perceptual component to track progress toward the goal and an action of how to proceed. Goals can be nested and stacked and several are possible but one proximal and concrete dominate the sphere of cognition: one's current concerns.
The term goal denotes a distributed representation that links 3 components:

an affective meaningful outcome
stimulus representations for progress toward goal achievement
action plans toward achieving the outcome.

This for hot goals, different from cold and different from affective states (being hungry).
Principle 2: Once activated, progress toward goals drives incremental DA release and reinforces actions and subgoals toward these goal states. Progress includes estimated time to achievement, degree of uncertainty of achievement, perceptual distance to goal state. This gradual progress leads to steady delivery of DA. Csq: impossible to stop close to goal: many examples.
Principle 3: It is relatively hard to activate new goals: brain at its most perfectionistic in weighting costs and benefits at the goal selection phase. (Difficile de choisir mais qd c'est fait on ne change plus). Dissociation of the value system between goal selection and goal engaged.
Principle 4: Despite the positive bias evident during goal engagement stage, a more balanced estimation of value does accumulate. Qd pas bon, on continue de le faire qd même mais on s'en souvient p ne pas selectionner la prochaine fois.
Principle 5: Not all goals achievable and system poised to detect when to give up on a given goal. When persistent lack of progress, goal reevaluation (steady progress is needed). More easy to try alternative strategies in cold lPFC than abandon an affective goal (depressed when give up, disappointment; not for strategies).
Principle 6: Aversive goal is an oxymoron: all goals are fundamentally appetitive. In aversive situations, goals focus on ways to avoid or overcome.
Principle 7: Goal activation is graded and not everything is goal-driven. en parallel à goal en cours, on peut faire autre chose, en mode habits model free en particulier.
In summary, two phases of cognition: goal selection and goal engaged; goal selection is the prime directive. puis resolution, donc moments critiques at every juncture.
Overview of proposed computational framework:
Central questions addressed: how do goals gain control of central neuromodulatory brain areas projecting to the rest of the brain to control learning and other dynamics? How are new goals activated?
Elaboration de gdPVLV (gd = goal-driven). Primary values affectively relevant (and associated to certain brain areas); learned values to associate to perceptual inputs and measures of distance. cf fig 2, liste de affective states et corresponding concrete goal and PV outcome. PV goals in v/mPFC OFC and ACC et primary values in ventral striatum. cf aussi liste autres buts plus sociaux (faire partie du gpe, se faire comprendre, curiosité vers nvelle info, etc.).
Role OFC: encoding running estimates of progress toward desired goal outcomes (primary values PV). Role of ACC: processing costs associated to specific ways of pursuing different goals: representation of utility expected from each goal-state/action-plan pair (???).
Y hierarchical pyramid of goal processing areas in the brain: au sommet, v/mPFC et ventral striatum (pvlv), analog prelimbic and infralimbic existe dejà in rodents avec petite partie du prelimbic homologous of the vast lPFC in primates (Narayanan06); ds OFC et ACC, Y aussi mechanism of active maintenance et adaptive gating que ds lPFC et en plus privileged access to other limbic areas, useful for goal processing. Mechanisms du genre incremental updating, running average of reward, effort, temporal derivative of running averages, link to phasic and tonic signals.
Description de la decomposition en sub-goals avec role du parietal dans cette decomposition en action à partir de perceptual and motor representation.
Computational Model of Rat Foraging Behavior
Test avec virtual rat ds plus maze et outcomes sur chaque location (protein, water, sugar, vegetables) mais p chacun chance of experiencing resp bitter, sour, rotten representant possible negative costs, effort, etc. goal = exploration depending on deprivation to optimize utility.
Period of purely random exploration (??? realist??? mais aussi reflecting background developmental learning processes) for initial associations, Selon needs (type of lack), activate corresponding positive outcome representation in OFC (the PV that satisfy the needs), connected to the corresponding ACC action plan value representations, utility of approaching the corresponding place with action plan itself encoded in dlPFC, receiving from ACC; Aussi interconnecté avec OFC negative outcome neurons (ou correspondant à sub-genual ACC area 25 ?) p negative outcomes associated with these actions. Donc ACC action plan representations coordinate multiple different OFC value representations, organized according to the relevant outcomes associated with different actions. cf role cortical processing ds constaint satisfaction with excitation and inhibition (OReilly13 et 12) et role frontal en particulier (Snyder 10 et 11) ds la vue de boucle avec BG et active maintenance par direct pathway. Decrit aussi d'autres étapes p selection du but puis realisation et reward ds amyg.
Testable predictions of the model: VS activity concentrated at start and end of tasks; dorsal striatum tracks online action selection during task performance: VS provides the discrete WM updating signals for goal maintenance in OFC and ACC at the transition from goal selection to goal engagement and then again to desactivate goals upon goal achievement and enable a new round of goal selection. Dorsal striatum involved in selecting online action plans along the task.
Integration of reward and cost depends on ACC and connections with BLA and VS. cf Walton03 et Rudebeck06.
OFC-mediated goal progress signals important for sustaining goal engagement (but explicit sensory cues can also suffice). OFC = highest level of the LV goal-progress tracking system. Capable of active maintenance of estimates of progress even in the absence of sensory input (OFC lesion = impulsive choice).
OFC important for outcome-based action selection (eg outcome devaluation). ??? ou ds mPFC mais ici bien etabli ; voir frontiere ou continuité mPFC/OFC???
Value function dissociations between goal selection and goal engaged modes. Goal selection: conservative weighting of costs and benefits. Goal engaged: progress toward the goal.
gdPVLV
reframing of PVLV from the goal-first point of view. Natural landmarks for perceptual cues of the distance to the goal for the LV system (in CeM ???). LV = proba of goal PV achievement through learned connections with perceptual inputs. Décrit les equations correspondantes. cf Hazy10 for second version of PVLV. A revoir en détail. Pour le cas pain et dips, role de LatHabenula mais plutot pour des 'anti-goals' à éviter.
A Goal-Processing Pyramid in the Brain
Pyramid inverted with narrow aspect in subcortical areas for PV system. When particular motivational state engaged, subcortical region for processing the relevant PV are up-regulated (primitive form of attention). Sensory inputs previously associated with those PV (food location) will activate LV representations for approach behavior. This system remains engaged as long as hungry. cf Fig 8. Core (positive and negative) PV in resp LH and MH; Core LV (pos and neg) in CeM and CeC/L; Higher level (more differentiated) PV and LV in BLA projecting to CeA and connected to OFC for anticipatory PV in reaction to LV-cues. BLA also connected to VS for driving gating of OFC and other v/mPFC by VS. At the highest level, OFC and ACC connected to lower levels including BLA and VS. OFC and ACC for overall maps of goal (cf Fig 9). cf sous-régions de OFC et continuité entre mOFC et sgACC p positive/negative PV et à un extrême lOFC plutot p sensory values from the senses vers vlPFC et WM/control over sensory what et pgACC p motor-action specific values (effort) vers dlPFC et action plans. et au milieu rmPFC for episodic input from the hippocampus. Contrast OFC/ACC: cf Rushworth07, Rudebeck08 et autres ref.
From this map of goals, propose to associate stimulus-driven OFC areas to LV stimulus driven graded representations of progress toward goals; ACC for representing affective consequences of actions to shape the selection process.
Taxonomy of Primary Values: putting emotional and motivational states in a goal-centric perspective. Distinguish affective states (more general, diffuse: drive) and outcomes. Reiss04 proposes a list of 16 intrinsic motivations. cf details.
Discussion
Central idea that goals are primary and one must have an active goal engaged. Process of goal selection by careful weighting of costs/benefits; when selected and engaged, dominate the effective value function, biased toward rewarding progress toward the goal. Conservative value function during selection; optimistic goal-dominated value during goal engaged mode.
Models with goal-driven component often in the symbolic domain (refs Sun09; ACT-R). cf also model-based RL approaches with internal model (Daw05, Dayan09, Rangel10) for construction of a goal-space. cf also Solway12 for a bayesian approach for running internal model backwards, but pb of grounding in the real world: only the planning aspect and not complete goal-driven cognition.
Pezzulo09 relies on forward projection to anticipate outcomes (on ne le fait pas trop with goal-selection happening first): is this look-ahead process done by animals? even by humans? not clear.
Major issues: role lateralization p left-approach et right-avoidance ? mais reste des pbs p negative: fuir ds quelle direction? jusqu'où?
Decomposition in sub-goals as hierarchy of LV or second-order PV? role BLA? Learning beyond second-order is extremely limited (different de TD).
Difference strategies (le sujet ici) et tactiques (differentes manière d'arriver au même but) qui pourrait plutôt impliquer parietal et cerebellum. cf negative fb controller that minimize discrepency between goals and current perceptual inputs; alors que DA system has a strong positive fb RL dynamic (representations become stronger and more likely to be activated). Ds ce dernier cas, on construit une representation stable à réutiliser alors que ds le premier cas, on est plutôt sur flexibilité devant unpredictable disturbances, sans vraiment d'app.
Novel pb solving: the idea with goal selection first is that you 'see' the path to the solution first, including for some hard pb, breaking them in more tractable smaller pbs. How these strategies are learned?
Potential relevance to clinical disorders: MDD, OCD, ADHD.
cf role NE ds exploration/exploitation correspondant à chercher a new goal or sticking to the current goal.
 
??? OK p difference goal selection and goal engaged mais comment se fait exactement goal selection (pourquoi prime? quelle asymmetry?), besoin d'integrer cout, effort, etc. p faire selection (donc pas si rough que ça ?)

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the success of deep neural networks in many research areas. The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks is to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which lacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of reasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other hand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical inference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their generalization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require different rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for prediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong connection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and generalization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate the power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural architecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical expressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural modules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for inference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant performance on solving logical equations and variables. Furthermore, we test our approach on the practical task of recommendation by formulating the task into a logical inference problem. Experiments show that LINN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in Top-K recommendation, which verifies the potential of LINN in practice.},

Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by inﬂuential thinkers. Many have identiﬁed the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.},

The goal of this paper is to present the field of ontologies and give an overview of recent research in the field, in the context of education. As this paper presents a literature review, papers from the last five years were collected from the IEEE Xplore database, analysed and categorized based on the use of ontologies for: curriculum modelling and management, describing learning domains, learning data, and e-learning services. From the collected papers, a slightly growing trend in the contribution of ontologies to educational systems can be observed. Most studies used ontologies for describing learning domains, and some of the 95 collected papers could not fit in just one category because a system used more than one ontology. Throughout the work, the following contributions have been made: the term ontology was defined, the most common types of ontologies and commonly used methodologies for building ontologies were identified, and an overview of existing systems that use ontologies in the domain of education was given.},

	abstract = {Analyzing learning traces is presently highly required in e-learning environment. Several communities have been developed to address this need, such as those of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The main step of performing a learning analytics process is the educational data collection. Actually, learning environments such as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) generate a big amount of educational data. They can be divided into assessment data, collaboration data, communication data, and so on. When we focus on assessment, we can launch a new source of data that can be analyzed and hence contribute to the improvement of learning analytics field. In this paper, we explore, investigate and compare the set of learning analytics models in the literature. Then, we study them from assessment point of view. The only current learning analytics model which can support tracking and modeling assessment data is the xAPI data model. For this reason, we study and investigate the xAPI specification from assessment point of view. Based on identified weaknesses of xAPI specification, we propose an enhancement of its data model. This is to support the assessment analytics effectively. We present an ontological model for assessment analytics inspired from the xAPI specification. To validate our approach, we focus on massive learning traces extracted from a real MOOC. Thus, we define and execute the set of proposed steps of preprocessing stage that extracts assessment data from whole learning data. Furthermore, we develop a java semantic web application to convert assessment data extracted to OWL file according to our proposed ontological model for assessment analytics.},

	abstract = {Idea generation in interactive learning environments requires the consideration of the interactivity and materiality aspects of creativity. In educational robotics, idea generation is mediated through a technological object in a process allowing us to observe the three main components of divergent thinking: fluency, flexibility, and originality. Nevertheless, divergent thinking assessment has been mainly evaluated in the last decades through semantic idea generation tasks such the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), asking participants to write different uses for familiar objects. In our study, we aimed to analyze differences in the three divergent thinking components (fluency, flexibility, and originality) through the AUT as a semantic task and through an educational robotic task that engaged the participants in building their ideas interactively. Results show that the creative components are strongly correlated within but not between the two tasks, leading us to consider the differences in the creative processes engaged when generating ideas through building with robotic objects. The role of affordances in idea generation through educational robotics is discussed as an important difference to consider in the evaluation of creativity in interactive learning environments.},

The analysis and design of such games require integrating game design activities with educational design concepts (such as learning objectives, assessment methods, and educational content design). In addition, the integration of these domains require interdisciplinary team. As a result, a clear, concise communication between team members is a difficult goal to achieve and ambiguity could arise. An ontology, as a domain modeling tool, could be used as a meta-model to guide a SEG design and the development team, in addition to bridging the communication gap between the game design and pedagogic domains. There is little proof that a comprehensive web-enabled SEGs’ ontology, which is characterized by completion, consistency, and reusability, exists.

They benefit from the main characteristics of games, such as engagement and immersiveness to achieve pedagogic objectives. In spite of the promising results of SEGs reported in the literature, their analysis and design still require complex tasks that incorporate game design activities within an educational context. Ontologies that include concepts, relations, and governing rules for both games and education domains could offer an approach to solve such problem. An ontology, as a domain modeling tool, could be used as a meta-model to guide a SEG designer, in addition to bridging the communication gap between the game design and pedagogic domains. This paper presents a survey of available ontologies for SEGs in the literature, in addition to comparing them. We managed to find only two SEGs’ ontologies and a meta-model in the literature, and hence presented and compared them. After presenting the survey, and result analysis and general comparison, we followed an ontologies’ comparison method called OntoMetric for further evaluation of the current SEGs’ ontologies. Our research results revealed that SEGs’ ontologies in the literature have two main diverse perspectives. One perspective intensively focuses on the game domain concepts, and the other perspective focuses on the pedagogic domain concepts. In addition, there is little proof that a comprehensive web-based SEGs ontology, which is characterized by completion, consistency, and reusability exists.},

We also predicted that self-reported epistemic beliefs (i. e. assumptions about the nature and acquisition of knowledge) would be related to ill-defined, but not well-defined, solutions. Results confirmed these predictions. We concluded that well-defined and ill-defined problems require separate cognitive processes and that epistemic beliefs play an important role in ill-defined problem solving.

Each VCPO has its own set of attributes, they note, leading to different purposes, functions, aesthetic outcomes, and narratives. They argue that one key to understanding the impact of these toys is to determine, based on the diversity of their attributes, each VCPO's level of affordance. The authors suggest that the specific qualities of some play materials may help establish the scientific, mathematical, and technological foundations required in such professional disciplines as architecture and engineering. In contrast, they argue that the use of VCPOs hobbled by formulaic, scripted play properties may have the opposite effect, that the use of products manufactured with specialized, commercialized themes runs the risk of impeding self-regulation and even creative ideation. They hope their findings serve as a starting point for future studies that examine the benefits and shortcomings of specific play objects on cognitive development and creativity.},

The CMC framework was translated into a model of neural connectivity between brain regions homologous to CMC components. After the model was implemented and fitted using Dynamic Causal Modeling, its performance was compared against four alternative large-scale brain architectures that had been previously proposed in the field of neuroscience. The results show that the CMC outperforms the other four architectures within and across all domains. These findings suggest that a common, functional computational blueprint for human-like intelligence also captures the neural architecture that underpins human cognition.},

At time scales of approximately 1⁄3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level – more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this “embodiment level,” the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1⁄3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic bindings make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements.},

	abstract = {In recent years two main technologies for knowledge sharing and reuse have emerged: ontologies and problem solving methods (PSMs). Ontologies specify reusable conceptualizations which can be shared by multiple reasoning components communicating during a problem solving process. PSMs describe in a domain-independent way the generic reasoning steps and knowledge types needed to perform a task. Typically PSMs are specified in a task-specific fashion, using modelling frameworks which describe their control and inference structures as well as their knowledge requirements and competence. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to PSM specification, which is based on the use of formal ontologies. In particular our specifications abstract from control, data flow and other dynamic aspects of PSMs to focus on the logical theory associated with a PSM (method ontology). This approach concentrates on the competence and knowledge requirements of a PSM, rather than internal control details, thus enabling black-box-style reuse. In the paper we also look at the nature of PSM specifications and we show that these can be characterised in a task-independent style as generic search strategies. The resulting 'modelling gap' between methodindependent task specifications and task-independent method ontologies can be bridged by constructing the relevant adapter ontology, which reformulates the method ontology in task-specific terms. An important aspect of the ontologycentred approach described here is that, in contrast with other characterisations of task-independent PSMs, it does away with the simple, binary distinction between weak and strong methods. We argue that any method can be defined in either taskindependent or task-dependent style and therefore such distinction is of limited utility in PSM reuse. The differences between PSMs which affect reuse concern the ontological commitments which they make with respect to domain knowledge and goal specifications.},

	abstract = {This article outlines a framework of creativity based on functional neuroanatomy. Recent advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience have identified distinct brain circuits that are involved in specific higher brain functions. To date, these findings have not been applied to research on creativity. It is proposed that there are four basic types of creative insights, each mediated by a distinctive neural circuit. By definition, creative insights occur in consciousness. Given the view that the working memory buffer of the prefrontal cortex holds the content of consciousness, each of the four distinctive neural loops terminates there. When creativity is the result of deliberate control, as opposed to spontaneous generation, the prefrontal cortex also instigates the creative process. Both processing modes, deliberate and spontaneous, can guide neural computation in structures that contribute emotional content and in structures that provide cognitive analysis, yielding the four basic types of creativity. Supportive evidence from psychological, cognitive, and neuroscientific studies is presented and integrated in this article. The new theoretical framework systematizes the interaction between knowledge and creative thinking, and how the nature of this relationship changes as a function of domain and age. Implications for the arts and sciences are briefly discussed.},

There was a general decline in adaptive outcomes over time, but these trends were moderated by the different patterns of multiple goals.

Gaining novel insights can lead to mental reorganization of previously unrelated events, thus linking them into narratives. The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) support integration of partially overlapping events, but the neural mechanisms underlying the reorganization of memories for the formation of coherent narratives remain elusive. Here, we combine fMRI with The Sims 3 videos of life-like animated events, which could either be integrated into narratives or not. We show that insight triggers the emergence of de novo mnemonic representations of the narratives and is associated with increased neural similarity between linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus, mPFC, and autobiographical-memory network. Simultaneously, events irrelevant to the newly established memory of the narrative were pruned out. This process was accompanied by increased neural dissimilarity between non-linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus and mPFC and was additionally signaled by a mismatch response in the anterior hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that insight leads to neural reconﬁguration of representational networks within a memory space and have implications for knowledge acquisition in educational settings.},

	abstract = {1 Why develop an ontology? In recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of ArtificialIntelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have become common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large taxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for sale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is developing the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for encoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching for information. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in conjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by extending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the Web (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for example, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED (Price and Spackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System (Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For example, the United Nations Development Program and Dun \&amp; Bradstreet combined their efforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and services (www.unspsc.org). An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. Why would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:},

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.},

Knowledge Group Awareness (KGA) designates the intersubjective perception of teammates’ knowledge. The use of especially designed gaming interfaces allows KGA declaration and displaying support by the introduction of the KGA explicitness systems, called by some authors KGA tools (Buder, 2010).This paper aims to study whether a structured explicitness of the KGA could play a core role in facilitating and improving collaborative face to face GBL performances. The KGA is operationalized through the Feeling of Knowledge (FOK) declaration. The FOK refers to the feelings a student has regarding his/her knowledge for a specific subject (Hart, 1965), it is defined by the student using a Confidence Level (CL) based in a 3 level scale. We expect that the FOK declaration process will have a positive impact in the learning process based in the GBL task, both in individual and collaborative phases of the GBL activity proposed to the students. However, we expect better performances in collaborative settings with the explicitness of the KGA thanks to the socially shared metacognition process, developed through the displaying of the intersubjective FOK. For this purpose we designed a collaborative SG in the field of finance, introducing an ad hoc KGA explicitness system with the aim of supporting the students’ FOK declaration according to the 3 CL. The first is analyzing the impact of the declaration of the FOK in individual performance when playing alone. The second one is analyzing the influence of shared visualization of the intersubjective FOK in the individual and collaborative performances, according to the symmetry of knowledge between dyad members. This environment permits researchers study different variables in order to study four hypotheses on learner’s performances and changes in their Feeling of knowledge (FOK) accuracies during collaborative game experience.},

This book clarifies the role ontologies play in knowledge representation; it discusses the distinctions with their use in philosophy, gives insight in the features, rationale and limitations of the OWL 2 web ontology language, and provides a critical review of methodologies and design principles advocated to improve the quality of ontologies. It covers both theory and practice of knowledge acquisition, representation and ontologies; it emphasises human understanding as knowledge structuring principle, and demonstrates this approach in the development of a core ontology of basic legal concepts (LKIF Core) and in the exploration of expressive ontology design patterns for the representation of social reality, change and causation, actions and transactions. In doing so it contributes to a better understanding of the representation of ontologies; or rather, what it means to do ontology representation.},

Developers can compose problem-solving methods that accomplish complex application tasks from primitive, reusable methods. The key steps in this development approach are task analysis, method selection (from a library), and method configuration. Protégé-ii is a knowledge-engineering environment that allows developers to select and configure problem-solving methods. In addition, Protégé-ii generates domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tools that domain specialists can use to create knowledge bases on which the methods may operate. The board-game method is a problem-solving method that defines control knowledge for a class of tasks that developers can model in a highly specific way. The method adopts a conceptual model of problem solving in which the solution space is construed as a “game board” on which the problem solver moves “playing pieces” according to prespecified rules. This familiar conceptual model simplifies the developer's cognitive demands when configuring the board-game method to support new application tasks. We compare configuration of the board-game method to that of a chronological-backtracking problem-solving method for the same application tasks (for example, towers of Hanoi and the Sisyphus room-assignment problem). We also examine how method designers can specialize problem-solving methods by making ontological commitments to certain classes of tasks. We exemplify this technique by specializing the chronological-backtracking method to the board-game method.},

	abstract = {The visual system historically has been defined as consisting of at least two broad subsystems subserving object and spatial vision. These visual processing streams have been organized both structurally as two distinct pathways in the brain, and functionally for the types of tasks that they mediate. The classic definition by Ungerleider and Mishkin labeled a ventral “what” stream to process object information and a dorsal “where” stream to process spatial information. More recently, Goodale and Milner redefined the two visual systems with a focus on the different ways in which visual information is transformed for different goals. They relabeled the dorsal stream as a “how” system for transforming visual information using an egocentric frame of reference in preparation for direct action. This paper reviews recent research from psychophysics, neurophysiology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging to define the roles of the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams. We discuss a possible solution that allows for both “where” and “how” systems that are functionally and structurally organized within the posterior parietal lobe.},

By contrast, standard cognitive neuroscience typically uses the concept to refer to (action-oriented) representations in the brain. This paper will show that the view of affordances as representations firmly places the concept in the subject-object framework that dominates both psychology and neuroscience. Notably, Gibson introduced the affordance concept to overcome this very framework. We describe an account of the role of the brain in perception and action that is consistent with Gibson. Making use of neuroscientific findings of neural reuse, degeneracy and functional connectivity, we conceptualize neural regions in the brain as dispositional parts of perceptual and action systems that temporarily assemble to enable animals to directly perceive and - in the paradigmatic case - utilize the affordances of the environment.},

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.},

	abstract = {Graph analytics can lead to better quantitative understanding and control of complex networks, but traditional methods suffer from high computational cost and excessive memory requirements associated with the high-dimensionality and heterogeneous characteristics of industrial size networks. Graph embedding techniques can be effective in converting high-dimensional sparse graphs into low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces, preserving maximally the graph structure properties. Another type of emerging graph embedding employs Gaussian distribution-based graph embedding with important uncertainty estimation. The main goal of graph embedding methods is to pack every node's properties into a vector with a smaller dimension, hence, node similarity in the original complex irregular spaces can be easily quantified in the embedded vector spaces using standard metrics. The generated nonlinear and highly informative graph embeddings in the latent space can be conveniently used to address different downstream graph analytics tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction, community detection, visualization, etc.). In this Review, we present some fundamental concepts in graph analytics and graph embedding methods, focusing in particular on random walk-based and neural network-based methods. We also discuss the emerging deep learning-based dynamic graph embedding methods. We highlight the distinct advantages of graph embedding methods in four diverse applications, and present implementation details and references to open-source software as well as available databases in the Appendix for the interested readers to start their exploration into graph analytics.},

However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and construction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, controlled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In particular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abilities have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such relationships by hand. We introduce a novel cognitive agent model and architecture for online learning and reasoning that seeks to effectively represent, learn and reason in complex training environments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hypotheses from observed data, and infer new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenarios, with possible applications in a range of areas.},

	abstract = {Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a SRL framework which integrates neural networks with ﬁrst-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efﬁcient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classiﬁcation of an image’s bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-theart Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.},

While state-of-the-art learning from data typically use sub-symbolic distributed representations, reasoning is normally useful at a higher level of abstraction with the use of a ﬁrst-order logic language for knowledge representation. As a result, attempts at combining symbolic AI and neural computation into neural-symbolic systems have been on the increase. In this paper, we present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic formalism and computational model that supports learning and reasoning through the introduction of a many-valued, end-to-end diﬀerentiable ﬁrst-order logic called Real Logic as a representation language for deep learning. We show that LTN provides a uniform language for the speciﬁcation and the computation of several AI tasks such as data clustering, multi-label classiﬁcation, relational learning, query answering, semi-supervised learning, regression and embedding learning. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with a number of simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2. Keywords: Neurosymbolic AI, Deep Learning and Reasoning, Many-valued Logic.},

	abstract = {Mirror neurons within a monkey's premotor area F5 fire not only when the monkey performs a certain class of actions but also when the monkey observes another monkey (or the experimenter) perform a similar action. It has thus been argued that these neurons are crucial for understanding of actions by others. We offer the hand-state hypothesis as a new explanation of the evolution of this capability: the basic functionality of the F5 mirror system is to elaborate the appropriate feedback – what we call the hand state– for opposition-space based control of manual grasping of an object. Given this functionality, the social role of the F5 mirror system in understanding the actions of others may be seen as an exaptation gained by generalizing from one's own hand to an other's hand. In other words, mirror neurons first evolved to augment the “canonical” F5 neurons (active during self-movement based on observation of an object) by providing visual feedback on “hand state,” relating the shape of the hand to the shape of the object. We then introduce the MNS1 (mirror neuron system 1) model of F5 and related brain regions. The existing Fagg–Arbib–Rizzolatti–Sakata model represents circuitry for visually guided grasping of objects, linking the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) with F5 canonical neurons. The MNS1 model extends the AIP visual pathway by also modeling pathways, directed toward F5 mirror neurons, which match arm–hand trajectories to the affordances and location of a potential target object. We present the basic schemas for the MNS1 model, then aggregate them into three “grand schemas”– visual analysis of hand state, reach and grasp, and the core mirror circuit – for each of which we present a useful implementation (a non-neural visual processing system, a multijoint 3-D kinematics simulator, and a learning neural network, respectively). With this implementation we show how the mirror system may  learnto recognize actions already in the repertoire of the F5 canonical neurons. We show that the connectivity pattern of mirror neuron circuitry can be established through training, and that the resultant network can exhibit a range of novel, physiologically interesting behaviors during the process of action recognition. We train the system on the basis of final grasp but then observe the whole time course of mirror neuron activity, yielding predictions for neurophysiological experiments under conditions of spatial perturbation, altered kinematics, and ambiguous grasp execution which highlight the importance of the  timingof mirror neuron activity.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientific and psychological data suggest a close link between affordance and mirror systems in the brain. However, we still lack a full understanding of both the individual systems and their interactions. Here, we propose that the architecture and functioning of the two systems is best understood in terms of two challenges faced by complex organisms, namely: (a) the need to select among multiple affordances and possible actions dependent on context and high-level goals and (b) the exploitation of the advantages deriving from a hierarchical organisation of behaviour based on actions and action-goals. We first review and analyse the psychological and neuroscientific literature on the mechanisms and processes organisms use to deal with these challenges. We then analyse existing computational models thereof. Finally we present the design of a computational framework that integrates the reviewed knowledge. The framework can be used both as a theoretical guidance to interpret empirical data and design new experiments, and to design computational models addressing specific problems debated in the literature.},

"Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been proposed to make education more accessible, more effective and simultaneously as a way to provide useful ob jective metrics on learning." (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
"In this work we are more focused on the tutoring model, that is, how to choose the activities that provide a better learning experience based on the estimation of the student competence levels and progression, and some knowledge about the cognitive and student model." (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
"A third approach, and more relevant for our work, is that the optimization is made automatically without particular assumptions about the students or the knowledge domain." (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
"Our ITS aims at providing to each particular student the activities that are giving the highest learning progress." (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
"ing on particular teaching activities; iii) a tutoring model that defines, based on the cognitive and the student model, what teaching activities to present to students and iv) a user interface model that represents how the interaction with the students occurs and how problems are proposed to the learners. According to [13], there are four main components of an ITS: i) a cognitive model that defines the domain knowledge or which steps need to be made to solve problems in a particular domain; ii) a student model that considers how students learn, what is the evolution of their cognitive state depend-" (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
A représenter avec un schéma (note on p.2)
 
"Weaker dependency on the cognitive/student model" (Clément, et and al 2014:2)
"We consider that it is important to be as independent as possible of the cognitive and student model when deciding which activities to propose." (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"Efficient Optimization Methods" (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"More Motivating Experience" (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"at each time instance, the exercises that are providing the higher learning progress must be the ones proposed. This allows not only to use more efficient optimization algorithms but also to provide a more motivating experience to students." (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"the use of highly performing Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms [5]; a simpler factored representation of the cognitive model that maps activities to the minimum necessary competence levels; and considering that the acquisition of a KC is not a binary variable but defined as the level of comprehension of that KC. The advantage of using MAB is that they are computationally efficient and require a weaker dependency between the tutoring and the cognitive and student models. Other contributions include an algorithm to estimate student competence levels; and the empirical learning progress of each activity." (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"First, we model here the competence level of a student in a given KC as a continuous number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0 means not acquired at all, 0:6 means acquired at 60 percent, 1 means entirely acquired). We denote ci the current estimation of this competence level for knowledge unit KCi . In what we call a R Table, for each combination of an activity a and a KCi , the expert then associates a q−value (qi (a)) which encodes the competence level required in this KCi to have maximal success in this activity a. This in turn provides a upper and lower bound on the competence level of the student: below qi (a) in case of mistake; above qi (a) in case of answering correctly." (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"We start by assuming that each activity is represented by a set of parameters a = (a1 ; :::; ana ). The R Table then uses a factorized representation of activity parameters, where instead of considering all (a; KCi ) combinations and their corresponding qi (a), we consider only (aj ; KCi ) combinations and their corresponding qi (aj ) values, where qi (aj ) denotes the competence level in KCj required to succeed entirely in activity a which j − th parameter value is aj . This factorization makes the assumption that activity parameters are not correlated. The alternative would require a larger number of parameters and would also require more exploration in the optimization algorithm. We use the factorized R Table in the following manner to heuristically estimate the competence level qi (a) required in KCi to succeed in an activity na parameterized with a: qi (a) = qi (aj ) j =1" (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"stealth assessment" (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
évaluation furtive (note on p.3)
 
"Key to the approach is the estimation of the impact of each activity over the student's competence level in each knowledge unit. This requires an estimation of the current competence level of the student for each KCi . We do not want to introduce regular tests that might interfere negatively with the learning experience of the student. Thus, competence levels need to be inferred through stealth assessment [16] that uses indirect information from the results on the exercises." (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"When doing an activity a = (a1 ; :::; ana ), the student can either succeed or fail. In the case of success, if the estimated competence level ci in knowledge unit i is lower than qi (a), we are underestimating the competence level of the student in KCi , and so should increase it. If the student fails and qi (a) {\textless} ci , then we are overestimating the competence level of the student, and it should be decreased. For these two first cases we can define a reward: ri = qi (a) ci (1) and use it to update the estimated competence level of the student according to ci = ci + αri where α is a tunable" (Clément, et and al 2014:3)
"parameter that allows to adjust the confidence we have in each new piece of information." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"A crucial point is that the quantity ri = qi (a) ci is not only − used to update ci , but is used to generate an internal reward r = P ri to be cumulatively optimized for the ITS (details below). Indeed, we assume here that this is a good indicator of the learning progress over KCi resulting from doing an activity with parameters a." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"The intuition behind this is that if you have repeated successes in an activity for which the required competence level is higher than your current estimated competence level, this means you are probably progressing." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"RiARiT: Right Activity at Right Time" (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"To address the optimization challenge for ITS, we will rely on multi-arm bandit techniques (MAB)[5]. A particularity here is that the reward (learning progress) is non-stationary, which requires specific mechanisms to track its evolution. Indeed, here a given exercise will stop providing reward, or learning progress, after the student reaches a certain competence level. Also we cannot assume that the rewards are i.i.d. as different students will have different preferences and many human factors, i.e. distraction, mistakes on using the system, create several spurious effects. Thus, we rely here on a variant of the EXP4 algorithm [1, 5]. We consider a set of filters that track how much reward each exercise parameters is giving. Then the algorithm selects stochastically the teaching activities proportionally to the expected learning progress for each parameter. Expert knowledge can also be used by incorporating coarse global constraints on the ITS. Indeed, for example the expert knows that for most students it will be useless to propose exercises about decomposition of real numbers if they do not know how to add simple integers. Thus, the expert can specify minimal competence levels in given KCi that are required to allow the ITS to try a given parameter aj of activities." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"ZPDES: Zone of Proximal Development and Empirical Success" (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"Our goal is to reduce the dependency on the cognitive and student models and so we will try to simplify further the algorithm. Our simplification will take two sources of inspiration: zone of proximal development and the empirical estimation of learning progress." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"As discussed before focusing teaching in activities that are providing more learning progress can act as a strong motivational cue. Estimating explicitly how the success rate on each exercise is improving will remove the dependency on t Ck the R table. For this we replace Eq. 1 with r = P − k=1 t t−d Ck where Ck = 1 if the exercise at time k was solved k=1 t−d correctly. The equation compares the d + 1 more recent success with all the previous past, providing an empirical measure of how the success rate is increasing. We no longer estimate the competence level of the student, and directly use the reward estimation." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"improve motivation; further reduce the need of quantitative measures for the educational design expert; and provide sequence of activities that follow a more sequential order." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"This algorithm is identical to RiARiT but we treat the parameters that have a clear relation of increasing complexity differently. For the parameter i, when the expected learning progress of parameter j is below the level of the more complex parameter value, wi (j ) {\textless} wi (j + 1)=θ, and the success t Ck (j ) rate is higher than a pre-defined threshold : {\textgreater} k=1 t ω , we allow the parameter value j + 3 to be chosen and initiate it with: wi (j ) = 0 and wi (j + 3) = wi (j + 2)." (Clément, et and al 2014:4)
"In each exercise, one ob ject is presented with a given tagged price and the learner has to choose which combination of bank notes, coins or abstract tokens need to be taken from the wallet to buy the ob ject, with various constraints depending on exercises parameters. The five Knowledge Components aimed at in these experiments are: KnowMoney: Global skill characterizing the capability to handle money to buy ob jects in an autonomous manner; SumInteger: Capability to add and subtract integer numbers; DecomposeInteger: Capability to decompose integer numbers into groups of 10 and units; SumCents: Capability to add and subtract real numbers (cents); DecomposeCents: Capability to decompose real numbers (cents); Memory: Capability to memorize a number which is presented and then removed from visual field."

At a given point in time, the system proposes to the students the activity which makes them progress faster. We introduce two algorithms that rely on the empirical estimation of the learning progress, RiARiT that uses information about the difficulty of each exercise and ZPDES that uses much less knowledge about the problem. The system is based on the combination of three approaches. First, it leverages recent models of intrinsically motivated learning by transposing them to active teaching, relying on empirical estimation of learning progress provided by specific activities to particular students. Second, it uses state-of-the-art Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) techniques to efficiently manage the exploration/exploitation challenge of this optimization process. Third, it leverages expert knowledge to constrain and bootstrap initial exploration of the MAB, while requiring only coarse guidance information of the expert and allowing the system to deal with didactic gaps in its knowledge. The system is evaluated in a scenario where 7-8 year old schoolchildren learn how to decompose numbers while manipulating money. Systematic experiments are presented with simulated students, followed by results of a user study across a population of 400 school children.},

@article{romero_numerique_2020,
	title = {Le numérique va révolutionner l'éducation … vraiment ?},
	url = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02895694},
	abstract = {Nous entendons ou lisons très souvent-notamment dans binaire-que le numérique bouleverse à peu près toutes les facettes de nos vies. Que ce soit la médecine, le transport, l'industrie, le divertissement, quasiment tous les secteurs d'activité connaissent de profondes évolutions dues à l'informatique et ses applications. A première vue, l'éducation ne semble pas échapper à la règle si l'on croit les analyses les plus répandues. Gérard Giraudon et Margarida Romero, deux experts du numérique pour l'éducation, décryptent pour nous une vidéo de Derek Muller expliquant pourquoi ce n'est pas si simple. Pascal Guitton \& Thierry Viéville. Depuis le début du 20ième siècle, nos sociétés ont connu nombre de révolutions technologiques (thermodynamique, nucléaire, informatique...) qui ont impacté la plupart des domaines (industrie, transports, commerce, agriculture, média...). Mises à part quelques exceptions, l'éducation n'en fait pas partie et les cours sont toujours donnés par un·e seul·e enseignant·e à des groupes d'élèves réunis dans une salle de classe. Certains pourraient reprocher cet état … à l'inertie de l'institution. Mais l'une des raisons pour laquelle la technologie n'a pas révolutionné l'éducation est au coeur même de ce qui est son rôle spécifique : créer un contexte social et relationnel adapté pour accompagner dans l'apprentissage des savoirs scolaires et des compétences nécessaires. Les apprentissages scolaires ne se produisent pas spontanément par la simple socialisation de l'enfant (Tricot, 2014) : il est nécessaire d'organiser les situations d'apprentissage. A l'école, ces savoirs se développent dans un contexte scolaire et social avec d'autres apprenant·e·s et des enseignant·e·s attentionné·e·s. Dans une vidéo publiée en 2014, Derek Muller de Veritasium démystifie ces "révolutions" technologiques et place l'enseignant·e au coeur d'une relation éducative essentielle pour engager les élèves dans les activités d'apprentissage. Au delà de l'engagement et l'autonomisation de l'apprenant·e soulignés par Muller, nous devons également considérer le rôle des enseignant·e·s au niveau de l'ingénierie des activités d'apprentissage et de leur orchestration, sans oublier les précieuses rétroactions qui contribuent, plus généralement, aux apprentissages. https://youtu.be/GEmuEWjHr5c Au delà de la vidéo Oui « le rôle fondamental d'un enseignant n'est pas de fournir des informations, mais de guider le processus social d'apprentissage ; le travail d'un enseignant est d'inspirer, de mettre au défi, de motiver ses élèves à vouloir apprendre ». Et l'enseignant n'est pas qu'un animateur charismatique, il doit aussi avoir un rôle d'ingénieur pédagogique et de régulateur externe des processus d'apprentissage pendant l'activité et apporter des rétroactions permettant l'évaluation formative. Comme l'explique très bien André Tricot en partageant les études sur les innovations pédagogiques et apprendre avec le numérique (voir par exemple cette présentation vidéo), le numérique est souvent un outil de plus, qui n'apporte pas en soi, d'innovation pédagogique. L'innovation technologique apportée par des technologies comme la réalité augmentée (RA), réalité virtuelle (RV) ou encore la robotique pédagogique et les approches de fabrication numérique (maker) changent la médiation des échanges.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, digital learning has contributed to the transformation of K-12 education by using a variety of technology-enhanced pedagogical approaches, and it helps understand the basics of computational thinking (CT). In the area of CT for young learners, educators are experimenting with digital or digital-inspired methods to go beyond digital literacy, towards also improving other skills, such as problem-solving, logical thinking and abstraction. By improving these skills, we aim to empower learners with the required knowledge as technology users and to aid in mastering the technology to develop their creative and citizenship potential through them. This chapter will provide a literature review on studies conducted to teach computer programming and computational concepts to K-12 students using visual programming tools, unplugged activities and educational robotics while evaluating how it can also help improve CT skills.},

	abstract = {We report on a new setup allowing us to collect learning analytics (LA) during computational thinking unplugged or tangible playful activities. We target the development of computational thinking (CT) competency, including the initiation to informatics (i.e., computer science and technology), with the goal to evaluate and analyze the development of CT. Collecting LA is mandatory in this case and if adaptive learning is targeted. While collecting LA during online interactions is rather straightforward, automatically collecting LA when manipulating tangible objects is more challenging, especially in a context where low-cost greenIT material is required. The key idea here, contrary to usual “black-box” systems working (more or less) automatically, is to change the learning paradigm and involve the learner in the data collection, making the process transparent and allowing her or him to also learn how to learn. This is particularly pertinent here since we use Informatics tools in order to … initiate to Informatics and CT. This means that we have to redesign the activity scenario including its didactic and revisit the underneath pedagogy, which turns to be an interesting and innovative challenge.},

On retrouve dans ce passage un certain nombre d’expressions et de propositions qui sont également présentes dans le Conceptus. Dans ces deux textes de Pierre d’Ailly s’articulent certaines thèses sur le statut ontologique de la connaissance (acte, disposition, accident) et d’autres sur la fonction sémiologique ou représentationnelle du concept, chacune de ces approches apparaissant également indispensable pour définir la connaissance. Par là Pierre d’Ailly occupe une place importante dans l’histoire de des théories du langage et de la connaissance. Après avoir poussé au plus loin, dans le Conceptus, la résorption du langage parlé dans le langage mental, il réintroduit l’idée d’un usage instrumental des mots dans d’autres textes, mais il ne néglige pas pour autant la question du statut métaphysique de cet élément de base qu’est le concept comme connaissance, notitia.},

La reconnaissance de ces substrats cérébraux ouvre de nouvelles perspectives sur des processus tels que la croyance. Toutes les fonctions cognitives, qu'elles touchent principalement à l'individu ou à la relation de celui-ci avec son entourage, fournissent un champ d'application à la croyance. Dans ses formes les plus élaborées, la croyance interagit avec des activités cognitives complexes, touchant à la perception du corps, de l'espace et du temps, à la mémoire, au sens moral et à la représentation de la pensée d'autrui (“Theory of Mind”). Des constantes apparaissent dans la relation qu'entretient la croyance avec chacune des fonctions cognitives que les neurosciences ont mises à jour. Dans une perspective neurocognitive, la croyance pourrait assurer une fonction, celle de soulager l'activité mentale de la résolution de conflits internes. Suivant une hypothèse avancée, l'émergence de cette fonction aurait principalement répondu aux conflits qui naissent de l'état d'incertitude attaché à la conscience humaine. La croyance impliquerait donc un réseau de structures neuronales qui gèrent les choix d'une pensée vouée au doute et à l'espérance.},

Dans cet ouvrage, les trois auteures, formatrices d’enseignants, conjuguent leur expertise pour examiner de quelle manière les neurosciences peuvent éclairer l’apprentissage et soutenir l’élaboration de stratégies pédagogiques et orthopédagogiques adaptées. Elles proposent des réponses ou, mieux dit, des hypothèses de travail aux questions que se posent formateurs et enseignants dans l’exercice de leur métier.
À cette fin, ce livre, dont le lecteur est le héros, offre à tout moment la latitude de choisir où se rendre. Si le lecteur souhaite examiner sa pratique en posture « méta », il sera intéressé par le profil apprenant présenté dans la première partie. S’il se demande ce qu’il doit comprendre quand l’autre ne comprend pas, la deuxième partie lui offrira de nombreuses pistes. S’il cherche quelle approche privilégier en individuel ou en collectif, il lira les coins de l’intervention. S’il veut savoir comment les neurosciences aident à comprendre pourquoi certaines stratégies marchent mieux que d’autres, il lira les coins de la réflexion. Enfin, s’il se demande comment raconter le fonctionnement du cerveau à ses élèves, il choisira les coins de l’expérimentation.
Ce livre s’adresse à tout enseignant qui souhaite retrouver le plaisir d’exercer ce métier impossible, comme Freud se plaisait à le qualifier. Il s’adresse aussi à tout formateur d’enseignants qui souhaite instaurer une culture enseignante fondée sur le plaisir d’apprendre à apprendre toute la vie.},

En raison des mouvements de l’âme qui les caractérisent, Descartes a désigné ces phénomènes par le terme émotion, un mot qui à son époque signifiait émeute ou agitation. Aristote reconnaissait le même phénomène dans son emploi du mot kinèsis. En effet, les ressentis émotionnels sont des perceptions de l’engagement dynamique du corps dans l’interaction. Pourtant, la qualité cinesthésique des émotions a été délaissée par la plupart des théories psychologiques. Cet article présente les arguments plaidant en faveur d’un modèle perceptif de l’émotion qui défend l’idée que les émotions sont des attitudes corporelles exprimant la relation du sujet à l’objet émotionnel. Ces arguments sont basés sur les récentes avancées des sciences cognitives notamment en matière de cognition incarnée. Ce modèle perceptif décrit une séquence fonctionnelle du processus de l’émotion qui s’inscrit dans la perspective des théories multi-componentielles actuelles des émotions.},

Ce phénomène s’explique en particulier par les perspectives scientifiques majeures associées à l’étude de ces processus de contrôle de haut niveau et leur rôle déterminant pour approcher le développement psychologique de l’enfant au sens large. Les recherches dans ce domaine ont progressivement conduit à la formalisation de modèles théoriques intégratifs et la mise en perspective de liens fonctionnels étroits avec d’autres concepts essentiels de la psychologie. L’exploration des perturbations des FE et leur description sémiologique dans divers contextes cliniques pédiatriques a également progressé, tandis que les outils d’évaluation se sont à la fois généralisés et diversifiés. Malgré ces progrès considérables, plusieurs insuffisances sont à signaler, que ce soit en termes de modélisation théorique du développement typique, d’expertise clinique ou d’évaluation. Des pistes de recherche complémentaires sont proposées, afin de fournir des repères prospectifs qui soient de nature à améliorer les connaissances relatives à la neuropsychologie des FE de l’enfant dans les prochaines années.},

	abstract = {Rethinking the Notion of Affordance in its Semiotic Dynamics. As far as semiotic and cognitive theories are concerned, new digital texts and objects emphasize the need to refocus on the intimate connection between user and his environment, considered as a space where cognition emerges, is deployed and manipulated through repeated interactions between subject’s body and the technological and cultural world which surrounds him. In this case, the concept of “affordance” assumes a more central importance. Originally developed in the framework of the Gestalt theory, the notion of Aufforderungscharackter was subsequently reworked and made famous through the notion of affordance integrated in the ecological approach to visual perception conceived by James Gibson. However, the concept has successively been integrated into a more binary conception of cognition, which seems to be responsible for the loss of much of its heuristic power. I intend to go back here to the genesis of the notion and propose a semiotic and dynamic reinterpretation of this concept, where affordances can be seen as dispositions to act and patterns of expectation that are, from the beginning, intrinsically linked to the social and cultural dimensions of the human world. I will show how semiotic activity cannot take place in an infinitely brief presenttime, but needs to be comprehended into a more systemic approach to cognition, where the environment and the subject cannot be considered on the basis of a binary distinction, and where an intrinsically cultural microgenetic activity of perception and cognition is seen as necessary for the emergence of possibilities of action in material and digital objects. In this context, affordances may be explained as responses to a conceivable practical action made possible by habits that subjects consider on the basis of their inclusion into a system of practices and knowledge which foreshadows a specific and situated horizon of action.},

Nous nous attardons sur les études examinant les relations qu’entretiennent ces différents aspects du comportement humain avec les fonctions exécutives et les structures frontales. Les résultats rapportés montrent que les liens potentiels entre la théorie de l’esprit et le fonctionnement exécutif font encore beaucoup débat, et que l’étude des relations entre théorie de l’esprit et lobe frontal mérite d’être affinée. Les lésions frontales perturbent le traitement des émotions, mais les relations entre perturbation des fonctions exécutives et troubles du traitement des émotions restent inexplorées. La métacognition a été peu étudiée chez les patients dysexécutifs par lésions frontales, si ce n’est au travers de quelques études sur la métamémoire qui montrent que les patients frontaux ont globalement tendance à surestimer leurs performances. Cette surestimation ne semble pas nécessairement procéder d’un déficit exécutif, d’une incapacité de jugement, ni d’une méconnaissance du fonctionnement mnésique normal et pathologique. Il ne s’agit pas non plus d’une difficulté d’utilisation de connaissances. De plus, les différentes mesures métamnésiques obtenues chez les patients frontaux corrèlent peu entre elles, indiquant qu’elles engagent probablement des processus du contrôle métamnésique relativement indépendants qu’il conviendrait de spécifier. Enfin, il faudra aussi vérifier, avec des malades porteurs de lésions frontales et/ou de syndromes dysexécutifs, les propositions théoriques les plus récentes voulant que les concepts de théorie de l’esprit et de métacognition soient finalement assez proches.},

We present here a computational theory describing the evolution of the prefrontal cortex from rodents to humans as gradually adding new inferential Bayesian capabilities for dealing with a computationally intractable decision problem: exploring and learning new behavioural strategies versus exploiting and adjusting previously learned ones through reinforcement learning (RL). We provide a principled account identifying three inferential steps optimizing this arbitration through the emergence of (i) factual reactive inferences in paralimbic prefrontal regions in rodents; (ii) factual proactive inferences in lateral prefrontal regions in primates and (iii) counterfactual reactive and proactive inferences in human frontopolar regions. The theory clarifies the integration of model-free and model-based RL through the notion of strategy creation. The theory also shows that counterfactual inferences in humans yield to the notion of hypothesis testing, a critical reasoning ability for approximating optimal adaptive processes and presumably endowing humans with a qualitative evolutionary advantage in adaptive behaviour.},

	abstract = {La mémoire de travail est un système cognitif essentiel à notre vie quotidienne. Elle nous permet de conserver momentanément des informations dans le but de réaliser une tâche cognitive. Une des caractéristiques principales de ce type de mémoire est d’être limitée en capacité. Les raisons de cette limitation sont largement débattues dans la littérature. Certains modèles considèrent qu'une cause principale de l'oubli en mémoire de travail est l'existence d'un déclin temporel passif de l'activation des représentations mnésiques alors que d'autres modèles supposent que les interférences entre les informations suffisent à expliquer la capacité limitée de cette mémoire. Deux modèles computationnels ont été proposés récemment (TBRS* et SOB-CS) et illustrent parfaitement ce débat. En effet, ils décrivent de manière très différente ce qui se passe au cours d’une tâche de mémoire de travail impliquant à la fois la mémorisation et le traitement d’informations. En plus de s'opposer sur les causes de l’oubli, ils proposent des processus de maintien en mémoire de travail distincts : le rafraîchissement des informations pertinentes selon TBRS* versus la suppression des informations non pertinentes selon SOB-CS. Les travaux de cette thèse se sont organisés autour de deux objectifs principaux. Premièrement, cette thèse a porté sur l’étude de ces deux modèles et leur mécanisme de maintien. Pour cela, nous avons réalisé des expériences comportementales utilisant la tâche d’empan complexe afin de tester des hypothèses précises de ces modèles. Deuxièmement, nous avons étudié, à l'aide des modèles computationnels, les causes des déficits de mémoire de travail observés chez les personnes âgées, dans le but, à long terme, de créer ou d'améliorer les outils de remédiation. Concernant le premier objectif, les différents résultats d’études ont montré une discordance entre le comportement humain et les simulations. En effet, TBRS* et SOB-CS ne permettent pas de reproduire un effet positif du nombre de distracteurs contrairement à ce qui a été observé expérimentalement. Nous proposons que cet effet positif, non prédit par les modèles, est relié à la mémorisation à long terme non prise en compte dans ces deux modèles. Concernant le deuxième objectif, les résultats comportementaux suggèrent que les personnes âgées auraient principalement des difficultés à rafraîchir les traces mnésiques et à stabiliser les informations à long terme au cours d’une tâche d’empan complexe. Dans l’ensemble, les résultats de cette thèse suggèrent d'approfondir les recherches concernant les liens entre les mécanismes de maintien en mémoire de travail et la mémorisation à long terme, par exemple en proposant un nouveau modèle computationnel permettant de rendre compte de nos résultats. Au-delà des avancées concernant la compréhension du fonctionnement de la mémoire de travail, cette thèse montre également que l’utilisation de modèles computationnels revêt un caractère particulièrement pertinent pour l'étude d'une théorie ainsi que pour la comparaison de différentes populations.},

Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance. The theory assumes a limited capacity working memory that includes partially independent subcomponents to deal with auditory/verbal material and visual/2- or 3-dimensional information as well as an effectively unlimited long-term memory, holding schemas that vary in their degree of automation. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel instructional procedures based on the assumption that working memory load should be reduced and schema construction encouraged.

	abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251–296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20 years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

	abstract = {We establish and generalise several bounds for various random walk quantities including the mixing time and the maximum hitting time. Unlike previous analyses, our derivations are based on rather intuitive notions of local expansion properties which allows us to capture the progress the random walk makes through \$t\$-step probabilities. We apply our framework to dynamically changing graphs, where the set of vertices is fixed while the set of edges changes in each round. For random walks on dynamic connected graphs for which the stationary distribution does not change over time, we show that their behaviour is in a certain sense similar to static graphs. For example, we show that the mixing and hitting times of any sequence of \$d\$-regular connected graphs is \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$, generalising a well-known result for static graphs. We also provide refined bounds depending on the isoperimetric dimension of the graph, matching again known results for static graphs. Finally, we investigate properties of random walks on dynamic graphs that are not always connected: we relate their convergence to stationarity to the spectral properties of an average of transition matrices and provide some examples that demonstrate strong discrepancies between static and dynamic graphs.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, such as in information retrieval, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc. However, the open nature of KGs often implies that they are incomplete, having self-defects. This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01346},
	abstract = {An important part of many machine learning workflows on graphs is vertex representation learning, i.e., learning a low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex in the graph. Recently, several powerful techniques for unsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification and edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the graph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural properties are then encoded in the vector representation space. However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to static graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time. Static representation learning methods are not able to update the vector representations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the vector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of the extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk based methods to dynamic graphs. The computation complexity of our algorithms depends upon the extent and rate of changes (the number of edges changed per update) and on the density of the graph. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on real world datasets for downstream machine learning tasks of multi-class and multi-label vertex classification. The results show that our algorithms can achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.},

We target problem-solving tasks using tangible interfaces for computational thinking initiation, and describe in details how we model the task and the learner behavior in this task, including goal-driven versus stimulus-driven behavior and the learner knowledge construction. We show how formalizing these elements using an ontology offers a well-defined computational model and the possibility of inferences about model elements, analyzing and predicting the learner behavior.

Notwithstanding decades of neuropsychological and neuroimaging work on the cognitive and neural substrate of semantic representations, many questions are left unanswered. The research in this dissertation attempts to unravel one of them: are the neural substrates of different components of concrete word meaning dissociated? In the first part, I review the different theoretical positions and empirical findings on the cognitive and neural correlates of semantic representations. Crucially, I propose an operational distinction between motor-perceptual dimensions (i.e., those attributes of the objects referred to by the words that are perceived through the senses) and conceptual ones (i.e., the information that is built via a complex integration of multiple perceptual features). In the second part, I present the results of the studies I conducted in order to investigate the automaticity of retrieval, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics of motor-perceptual and conceptual dimensions of word meaning. The results suggest that the neural substrates of different components of symbol meaning can be dissociated in terms of localization and of the feature of the signal encoding them, while sharing a similar temporal evolution.},

How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. “An X is a Y that is Z”). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic “module,” however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically “dedicated” symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

We show how a close examination of a very general task (strategic planning) leads to a catalog of the concepts and facts that must be encoded for general commonsense reasoning. These concepts are sorted into a manageable number of coherent domains, one of which is the representational area of commonsense human memory. We then elaborate on these concepts using textual corpus-analysis techniques, where the conceptual distinctions made in natural language are used to improve the definitions of the concepts that should be expressible in our formal theories. These representational areas are then analyzed using more traditional knowledge representation techniques, as demonstrated in this article by our treatment of commonsense human memory.},

Participants more frequently endorsed conclusions as possible than as necessary, and differences in response to the 2 forms of instruction conformed to several predictions derived from the mental model theory of deduction. Findings of Experiments 2 and 3 showed that some fallacies are consistently endorsed and others consistently resisted when people are asked to judge whether conclusions that are only possible follow necessarily.

Key principles are that the semantics of possibilities are the same finitary alternatives underlying probabilities, that speech acts can create obligations inexpressible as probabilities, that compound assertions – conditionals and disjunctions – refer to conjunctions of possibilities holding in default of knowledge to the contrary, and that mental models condense multiple consistent possibilities into one.

	abstract = {We describe a dual‐process theory of how individuals estimate the probabilities of unique events, such as Hillary Clinton becoming U.S. President. It postulates that uncertainty is a guide to improbability. In its computer implementation, an intuitive system 1 simulates evidence in mental models and forms analog non‐numerical representations of the magnitude of degrees of belief. This system has minimal computational power and combines evidence using a small repertoire of primitive operations. It resolves the uncertainty of divergent evidence for single events, for conjunctions of events, and for inclusive disjunctions of events, by taking a primitive average of non‐numerical probabilities. It computes conditional probabilities in a tractable way, treating the given event as evidence that may be relevant to the probability of the dependent event. A deliberative system 2 maps the resulting representations into numerical probabilities. With access to working memory, it carries out arithmetical operations in combining numerical estimates. Experiments corroborated the theory's predictions. Participants concurred in estimates of real possibilities. They violated the complete joint probability distribution in the predicted ways, when they made estimates about conjunctions: P(A), P(B), P(A and B), disjunctions: P(A), P(B), P(A or B or both), and conditional probabilities P(A), P(B), P(B{\textbar}A). They were faster to estimate the probabilities of compound propositions when they had already estimated the probabilities of each of their components. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of probabilistic reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

O n e deals with the information processing distance between the user’s intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves.

Among the significant issues that arise when setting up a learning network is the question of how to support communication between repositories that employ different schemes for describing learner profiles. To guarantee correct interpretation, a semantic common metadata schema is required. This paper aims to propose an ontological structure for representing a learner profile that augments it with semantics and provides a common vocabulary for the exchange of the different learner's characteristics that can be presented in a learner model. The proposed structure is based on different learner information with respect to well-known learner model specifications. Besides, it reuses terms from well-developed Semantic Web vocabularies which make it semantic web compliant and integrates different domain taxonomies and subject taxonomies that are used as ranges for particular concepts' slots.},

Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Speciﬁcally, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

Affordances on the other hand, provide symbolic grounding mechanisms that enable linking features obtained from visual perception with the functionality of the objects, which provides the most consistent and holistic characterization of an object. Recognition by Component Affordances (RBCA) is a recent theory that builds affordance features for recognition. As an extension of the psychophysical theory of Recognition by Components (RBC) to generic visual perception, RBCA is well suited for cognitive visual processing systems which are required to perform implicit cognitive tasks. A common task is to substitute a cup for a mug, bottle, jug, pitcher, pilsner, beaker, chalice, goblet or any other unlabeled object, but with a physical part affording the ability to hold liquid and a part affording grasping by a human hand, given the goal of ’finding an empty cup’ and no cups are available in the work environment of interest. In this paper, we present affordance features for recognition of objects. Using a set of 25 structural and 10 material affordances we define a database of over 250 common household objects. This database called the Affordance Network or AfNet is available as community development framework and is well suited for deployment on domestic robots. Sample object recognition results using AfNet and the associated inference engine that grounds the affordances through visual perception features demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a broad overview of the last 40 years of research on cognitive architectures. Although the number of existing architectures is nearing several hundred, most of the existing surveys do not reflect this growth and focus on a handful of well-established architectures. While their contributions are undeniable, they represent only a part of the research in the field. Thus, in this survey we wanted to shift the focus towards a more inclusive and high-level overview of the research in cognitive architectures. Our final set of 86 architectures includes 55 that are still actively developed, and borrow from a diverse set of disciplines, spanning areas from psychoanalysis to neuroscience. To keep the length of this paper within reasonable limits we discuss only the core cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention mechanisms, learning and memory structure. To assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we gathered information on over 700 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list. We use various visualization techniques to highlight overall trends in the development of the field. Our analysis of practical applications shows that most architectures are very narrowly focused on a particular application domain. Furthermore, there is an apparent gap between general research in robotics and computer vision and research in these areas within the cognitive architectures field. It is very clear that biologically inspired models do not have the same range and efficiency compared to the systems based on engineering principles and heuristics. Another observation is related to a general lack of collaboration. Several factors hinder communication, such as the closed nature of the individual projects (only one-third of the reviewed here architectures are open-source) and terminological differences.},

Each model represents an equiprobable alternative unless individuals have beliefs to the contrary, in which case some models will have higher probabilities than others. The probability of an event depends on the proportion of models in which it occurs. The theory predicts several phenomena of reasoning about absolute probabilities, including typical biases. It correctly predicts certain cognitive illusions in inferences about relative probabilities. It accommodates reasoning based on numerical premises, and it explains how naive reasoners can infer posterior probabilities without relying on Bayes's theorem.

When improving creative climates in work settings, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the various mechanisms of creativity and what strengthens or diminishes them. Design/methodology/approach ‐ Creativity research is fragmented and involves multiple aspects, levels and disciplines, ranging from biology to psychology and sociology. Concepts from systems science have particular value in understanding creativity, as they provide a transdisciplinary language of how systems work and adapt. This conceptual paper makes use of the language and concepts from the systems field to connect often disparate perspectives and clarify key mechanisms of creativity. Findings ‐ The core of this paper is a newly developed multilevel model of the creative mind. The proposed concepts provide a starting point for integrating further theoretical findings. Practical implications ‐ Improved understanding of creativity could help leaders more effectively use their creativity while facilitating the creativity of others for successful cooperation and problem-solving. Originality/value ‐ The visual models introduced here help bridge theory and practice while creating a stronger link between creativity research and studies in systems, cybernetics and complexity.},

Résumé
Historiquement, 2 noms :
-Platon ("inspiration is a kind of madness")
-Kant (creativity similar to imagination ; no creativity in sciences)
Peu de travaux avant les années 2000, et les ressources actuelles sont surtout en psychologie
Graham Wallace : 4 stages de processus créatifs (préparation, incubation, illumination, vérification)
Ward : generate and explore (2 stages)
Is creativity a virtue? plutôt oui pour la personalité créative, mais reliée à des vices ("hostile, impulsive"), faut-il désunir les qualificatifs?
Rationality of creativity : Association entre créativité, irrationalité et folie (see Platon), remis en question (ex Jon Elster : maximiser l'"artistic value" est un processus rationnel); correlation between psychopathologies and creativity
Créativité en opposition au traditionnel : besoin de traditions pour exprimer la créativité-{\textgreater} Créativité est culturelle
Modèle darwinien de la crativité : blind generation (DT?) into selection stage (CT?) Definir "blind" est important : pas full random, sinon on ne pourrait pas donner de crédit au processus créatif; bref, il faut essayer de bien définir blindness.
 
Can creativity be explained? Pas forcément possible d'en donner une explication naturaliste, mais on peut expliquer comment elle est possible (Briskman)
Boden : Combinational, exploratory, transformational. Discuté (par Novitz par ex) car les distinctions nécessitent un 'conceptual space" à explorer ou transformer, ce qui n'est pas forcément vrai.                                   Searle : without understanding, no creativity.
Briskman : Dans tous les cas, la créativité est du problem-solving (peut-être différent pour les artiustes, d'où l'absence des découvertes indépendantes)
 
Def : original and valuable. Plutôt que original, la surprise peut être meilleure pour définir.
H-creativity (historical; no one else had the idea) \& P-creativity (psychological; new to individuals)
Dark creativity is valuable? No, destructiv-ity (Novitz); yes, because it serves the agent's purpose (Cropley)
Value and original alone? No,Tectonique des plaques -{\textgreater} prdouit des diamants et certaines structures sont originales.
Aussi, il faut exclure les résultats "par chance" (e.g renverser de la peinture)-{\textgreater} Nécessite du skill ou de la compréhension, du jugement individuel et une capacité d'évaluation de la tâche. Regroupé sous le terme de flair (flair)-{\textgreater} Novel, valuable by flair
 
CRéativity is not means-to-end (non téléologique) for  eg Collingwood -{\textgreater} anti-teleological argument : bottom-up? propulsive model
rejection of anti-teleological argument : top-down? Connaître le goal, mais pas la démarche par exemple.
 
Imagination \& Créativité : l'un est une base de l'autre; pretend-play serait une base de créativité? Gaut indique que l'imagination peut être en état de créativité active, auquel cas cela rejoint la créativité.},

	abstract = {Enterprises have made amazing advances by taking advantage of data about their business to provide predictions and understanding of their customers, markets, and products. But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today. The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way. The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.},

Age, gender, schooling, occupation, marital status, and hobbies of the participants were taken into account. Factorial analyses showed that different conceptions of learning can be identified and that some of them are affected by age, gender, and the hobbies practised by the respondents. Older participants and women considered learning as an interpersonal and focused process to a larger extent. Older participants expressed negative feelings about learning, whereas women expressed positive feelings. Satisfaction with life changed according to marital status with married people scoring higher. Creative skills decreased with age and were influenced by gender, level of education, marital status, and hobbies practiced. Associations between conceptions of learning and satisfaction with life and creativity emerged. Implications for interventions addressing older adults’ well-being are discussed.},

They discuss not only formal cooperative learning but also informal cooperative learning, cooperative base groups, and cooperative structures. They emphasize that cooperation is more than a seating arrangement, that educators must attend to these essential components:  * Positive interdependence * Individual accountability/personal responsibility * Face-to-face promotive interaction * Interpersonal and small-group skills * Group processing Conflict is inevitable in any environment, and the authors provide succinct advice on managing conflict to creative a cooperative environment, structuring academic controversies, teaching procedures and skills, structuring a peacemaking program, teaching negotiation/mediation procedures and skills, and arbitrating as a last resort.

This paper addresses the aspects of integration and automatic deployment of educational games in Learning Management Systems. This integration simplifies the introduction of games in educational settings, leveraging the pre-existing technological infrastructure. Our approach is based on the automatic packaging and exportation of games as self-contained Learning Objects that can be easily distributed through any LMS compliant with the current interoperability standards. We thus inherit the advantages of the Learning Object model in terms of interoperability and, when supported by the LMS, in terms of student tracking and assessment.},

The proposed pattern relies on the descriptions and situations ontology pattern, combined with a frame-based representation scheme. Inspired by the aﬀordance theory and behaviour-based robotics principles, our reference model enables the deﬁnition of weighted relationships, or aﬀordances, between situations (representing agent’s perception of the environmental and social context) and agent’s functional and behavioral abilities. These weighted links serve as a basis for supporting runtime task selection and arbitration policies, to dynamically and contextually select agent’s behaviour. The pattern is at the heart of the behaviour-based cognitive approach adopted in the EU H2020 MARIO project for the design of an autonomous service robot (i.e., the cognitive agent) to support elderly people with cognitive impairments.},

We use ontologies to create a machine-processable representation of learners, learning content and their semantics. We also introduce the concept of “Cognitive Space Time”, abbreviated as CST. This is a multi-dimensional hyperspace the dimensions of which represent arbitrary meta data items describing the properties and semantics of learning material as well as personal traits and the progress of a learner. Recorded over time, each learner draws a trajectory in that hyperspace, which we build and analyze with spatio-temporal data structures and algorithms that are known from the ﬁeld of spatio-temporal databases. Finally, we explain how our ontologies and the CST can be used to create adaptive systems. We do this on a universal basis that is derived from the concept of the Turing machine. Therefore, our idea provides a technology-independent design strategy that can be implemented in any form of automaton. Both the ontology approach and the CST have been implemented in prototype systems that are presented in this document.},

While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral tasks by name (e.g., the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. Drawing from the taxonomy developed and used by the BrainMap project (                            www.brainmap.org                                                     ) for almost two decades to describe key components of published functional imaging results, we have developed an ontology capable of representing certain characteristics of the cognitive paradigms used in the fMRI and PET literature. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology is being developed to be compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and to harmonize where possible with larger ontologies such as RadLex, NeuroLex, or the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The key components of CogPO include the representation of experimental conditions focused on the stimuli presented, the instructions given, and the responses requested. The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. Categorization of paradigms according to stimulus, response, and instruction has been shown to allow advanced data retrieval techniques by searching for similarities and contrasts across multiple paradigm levels. The goal of CogPO is to develop, evaluate, and distribute a domain ontology of cognitive paradigms for application and use in the functional neuroimaging community.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for an adaptive mechanism implemented in Moodle in order to improve learning outcomes and students' satisfaction with the learning process. The proposed mechanism adapts the learning content within the course according to students' characteristics expressed by their learning style. In our study, student's learning style is dynamically determined by monitoring students’ actions and activities during the learning process, and detecting patterns of behavior that correspond to specific learning style. Semantic web technologies are in the background of the entire adaptive system. In order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model and students' feedback, an evaluation study was conducted on two groups of students. Students from the control group had access to standard Moodle course, while students from experimental group had access to personalized learning content. The results indicated that students' performance was improved by using the proposed framework, while the student's feedback from regarding its usefulness was positive.},

Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds—Montessori and traditional, matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence—to examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, including creative thinking.},

It remains an open question how the brain represents and processes associations. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a task, originally used in creativity research, that is heavily dependent on generating associations in a search for the solutions to individual RAT problems. In this work we present a model that solves the test. Compared to earlier modeling work on the RAT, our hybrid (i.e., non-developmental) model is implemented in a spiking neural network by means of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), demonstrating that it is possible for spiking neurons to be organized to store the employed representations and to manipulate them. In particular, the model shows that distributed representations can support sophisticated linguistic processing. The model was validated on human behavioral data including the typical length of response sequences and similarity relationships in produced responses. These data suggest two cognitive processes that are involved in solving the RAT: one process generates potential responses and a second process filters the responses.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neunet.2003.06.005},
	abstract = {This article is about how the brain data mines its sensory inputs. There are several architectural principles of functional brain anatomy that have emerged from careful anatomic and physiologic studies over the past century. These principles are considered in the light of representational learning to see if they could have been predicted a priori on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. We first review the organisation of hierarchical sensory cortices, paying special attention to the distinction between forward and backward connections. We then review various approaches to representational learning as special cases of generative models, starting with supervised learning and ending with learning based upon empirical Bayes. The latter predicts many features, such as a hierarchical cortical system, prevalent top-down backward influences and functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections that are seen in the real brain. The key points made in article are: (i). hierarchical generative models enable the learning of empirical priors and eschew prior assumptions about the causes of sensory input that are inherent in non-hierarchical models. These assumptions are necessary for learning schemes based on information theory and efficient or sparse coding, but are not necessary in a hierarchical context. Critically, the anatomical infrastructure that may implement generative models in the brain is hierarchical. Furthermore, learning based on empirical Bayes can proceed in a biologically plausible way. (ii). The second point is that backward connections are essential if the processes generating inputs cannot be inverted, or the inversion cannot be parameterised. Because these processes involve many-to-one mappings, are non-linear and dynamic in nature, they are generally non-invertible. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i.e. backward connections) to afford recognition and suggests that forward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient for perception. (iii). Finally, non-linearities in generative models, mediated by backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory, so that representations in higher cortical levels can interact to predict responses in lower levels. This is important in relation to functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections that have been demonstrated empirically.},

	abstract = {This review proposes that two networks of brain areas are involved in controlling attention. One network is primarily responsible for applying cognitive, top-down selection for stimuli and responses, whereas the other detects behaviourally relevant stimuli and might act as a 'circuit breaker' for the first system. Humans use cognitive information to direct attention to relevant objects (targets) in a visual scene. Information such as the target's colour or location is represented as a 'perceptual set'. Similarly, advance information about the required response to a target is represented as a 'motor set'. These can be considered together as an 'attentional set', which aids the detection of and response to targets. Such top-down control of attentional processes activates dorsal posterior parietal and frontal regions of the brain bilaterally in both monkeys and humans. This dorsal frontoparietal system is responsible for the generation of attentional sets. Attention can also be driven by stimulus properties rather than cognitive processes. This 'bottom-up' control of attention explains why we find ourselves drawn to 'oddball' stimuli that are very different from the background, or to salient stimuli that share some sensory features, such as colour, with the target for which we are searching. The dorsal frontoparietal system seems to maintain a 'salience map' that combines bottom-up with top-down information during visual search. Potentially important sensory stimuli, such as loud alarms or sudden movement, can attract our attention regardless of the ongoing task. This sensory orienting process seems to be mediated by the second attentional network, which is mainly lateralized to the right side of the brain and includes the temporoparietal junction and the ventral frontal cortex. This network seems to interrupt ongoing cognitive activity when a stimulus that might be behaviourally important is detected. These two networks could interact in humans to control attention. It is possible that damage to these networks is responsible for the syndrome of neglect, in which patients that have suffered damage to the right side of the brain tend to ignore stimuli on the left side of space. The authors suggest that neglect results from damage to the ventral network that also 'functionally inactivates' the dorsal network.},

	abstract = {Adaptive behavior relies on the selection of relevant sensory information from both the external environment and internal memory representations. In understanding external selection, a classic distinction is made between voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) guidance of attention. We have developed a task—the anti-retrocue task—to separate and examine voluntary and involuntary guidance of attention to internal representations in visual working memory. We show that both voluntary and involuntary factors influence memory performance but do so in distinct ways. Moreover, by tracking gaze biases linked to attentional focusing in memory, we provide direct evidence for an involuntary “retro-capture” effect whereby external stimuli involuntarily trigger the selection of feature-matching internal representations. We show that stimulus-driven and goal-directed influences compete for selection in memory, and that the balance of this competition—as reflected in oculomotor signatures of internal attention—predicts the quality of ensuing memory-guided behavior. Thus, goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors together determine the fate not only of perception, but also of internal representations in working memory.},

The present paper reports four experiments that were conducted in order to evaluate if human judgments of uncertainty conform better to possibility theory.

Then a new measurement apparatus is used, the Ψ-scale, to compare possibilistic vs. probabilistic disjunction and conjunction. Results strongly suggest that a human judgment is qualitative in essence, closer to a possibilistic than to a probabilistic approach of uncertainly. The paper also describes a qualitative heuristic, for conjunction, which was used by expert radiologists.},

	abstract = {Introduction The study of human judgment under uncertainty has a history that is almost contemporaneous with that of probability theories. This is not a coincidence. From the outset, the idea of using probability to describe cognitive states or aspects of subjective judgment has provoked debate, theory construction, and empirical research. It is no exaggeration to say that probability theories have exerted a strong prescriptive influence on the study of judgment and decision making (see Gigerenzer 1994 [21] and Smithson 1989 [41] for overviews). In the modern era, proponents of the Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) framework advocated a version of Bayesianism as the benchmark for rational judgment and decision making, and this viewpoint dominated studies of human judgment and decision making during the 50's and 60's. By the late 70's and early 80's, some scholars had begun to question whether we should regard deviations from probability theories as "irrational" (cf. Cohen 198},

Serendipity, however, is consistently associated with unexpected and positive personal, scholarly, scientific, organizational, and societal events and discoveries. Diverse serendipitous experiences share a conceptual space; therefore, what lessons can we draw from an exploration of how serendipity unfolds and what may influence it? This article describes an investigation of work-related serendipity. Twelve professionals and academics from a variety of fields were interviewed. The core of the semi-structured interviews focused on participants' own work-related experiences that could be recalled and discussed in depth. This research validated and augmented prior research while consolidating previous models of serendipity into a single model of the process of serendipity, consisting of: Trigger, Connection, Follow-up, and Valuable Outcome, and an Unexpected Thread that runs through 1 or more of the first 4 elements. Together, the elements influence the Perception of Serendipity. Furthermore, this research identified what factors relating to the individual and their environment may facilitate the main elements of serendipity and further influence its perception.},

Each cost function of the proposed algorithms is the weighted sum of squared errors, that is, the sum of squared errors with different penalties. When we discuss the possibility of Group 1, the penalty for the squared errors relating to the patterns in Group 1 is greater than that of Group 2. This means that, in the possibility analysis of Group 1, we attach greater importance to the patterns in Group 1 than to those in Group 2.

We introduce the concept of partial probability for propositions, substituting classical logic with Kleene's logic.

The formal similarities between 3-valued approaches to vagueness and formalisms that handle incomplete information often lead to a confusion between degrees of truth and degrees of uncertainty. Yet there are important differences that appear at the interpretive level: while truth-functional logics of vagueness are accepted by a part of the scientific community (even if questioned by supervaluationists), the truth-functionality assumption of three-valued calculi for handling incomplete information looks questionable, compared to the non-truth-functional approaches based on Boolean possibility–necessity pairs. This paper aims to clarify the similarities and differences between the two situations. We also study to what extent operations for comparing and merging information items in the form of orthopairs can be expressed by means of operations on valuation pairs, three-valued valuations and underlying possibility distributions.},

One attempt to limit the purview of creative cognition formulates the construct in terms of evolutionary constraints, namely that of blind variation and selective retention (BVSR). Behaviorally, one can limit the “blind variation” component to idea generation tests as manifested by measures of divergent thinking. The “selective retention” component can be represented by measures of convergent thinking, as represented by measures of remote associates. We summarize results from measures of creative cognition, correlated with structural neuroimaging measures including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We also review lesion studies, considered to be the “gold standard” of brain-behavioral studies. What emerges is a picture consistent with theories of disinhibitory brain features subserving creative cognition, as described previously (Martindale, 1981). We provide a perspective, involving aspects of the default mode network (DMN), which might provide a “first approximation” regarding how creative cognition might map on to the human brain.},

	abstract = {What is creativity, and where does it come from? Creativity and Development explores the fascinating connections and tensions between creativity research and developmental psychology, two fields that have largely progressed independently of each other-until now. In this book, scholars influential in both fields explore the emergence of new ideas, and the development of the people and situations that bring them to fruition. The uniquely collaborative nature of Oxford's Counterpoints series allows them to engage in a dialogue, addressing the key issues and potential benefits of exploring the connections between creativity and development. Creativity and Development is based on the observation that both creativity and development are processes that occur in complex systems, in which later stages or changes emerge from the prior state of the system. In the 1970s and 1980s, creativity researchers shifted their focus from personality traits to cognitive and social processes, and the co-authors of this volume are some of the most influential figures in this shift. The central focus on system processes results in three related volume themes: how the outcomes of creativity and development emerge from dynamical processes, the interrelation between individual processes and social processes, and the role of mediating artifacts and domains in developmental and creative processes. The chapters touch on a wide range of important topics, with the authors drawing on their decades of research into creativity and development. Readers will learn about the creativity of children's play, the creative aspects of children's thinking, the creative processes of scientists, the role of education and teaching in creative development, and the role of multiple intelligences in both creativity and development. The final chapter is an important dialogue between the authors, who engage in a roundtable discussion and explore key questions facing contemporary researchers, such as: Does society suppress children's creativity? Are creativity and development specific to an intelligence or a domain? What role do social and cultural contexts play in creativity and development? Creativity and Development presents a powerful argument that both creativity scholars and developmental psychologists will benefit by becoming more familiar with each other's work.},

	abstract = {Intuition and insight are intriguing phenomena of non-analytical mental functioning: whereas intuition denotes ideas that have been reached by sensing the solution without any explicit representation of it, insight has been understood as the sudden and unexpected apprehension of the solution by recombining the single elements of a problem. By face validity, the two processes appear similar; according to a lay perspective, it is assumed that intuition precedes insight. Yet, predominant scientific conceptualizations of intuition and insight consider the two processes to differ with regard to their (dis-)continuous unfolding. That is, intuition has been understood as an experience-based and gradual process, whereas insight is regarded as a genuinely discontinuous phenomenon. Unfortunately, both processes have been investigated differently and without much reference to each other. In this contribution, we therefore set out to fill this lacuna by examining the conceptualizations of the assumed underlying cognitive processes of both phenomena, and by also referring to the research traditions and paradigms of the respective field. Based on early work put forward by Bowers et al. (1990, 1995), we referred to semantic coherence tasks consisting of convergent word triads (i.e., the solution has the same meaning to all three clue words) and/or divergent word triads (i.e., the solution means something different with respect to each clue word) as an excellent kind of paradigm that may be used in the future to disentangle intuition and insight experimentally. By scrutinizing the underlying mechanisms of intuition and insight, with this theoretical contribution, we hope to launch lacking but needed experimental studies and to initiate scientific cooperation between the research fields of intuition and insight that are currently still separated from each other.},

The aim is to move towards a model which allows detailed comparison, and hence better understanding, of systems which exhibit behaviour which would be called “creative” in humans. The work paves the way for the description of naturalistic, multi-agent creative AI systems, which create in a societal context.I demonstrate some simple reasoning about creative behaviour based on the new framework, to show how it might be useful for the analysis and study of creative systems. In particular, I identify some crucial properties of creative systems, in terms of the framework components, some of which may usefully be proven a priori of a given system.I suggest that Boden’s descriptive framework, once elaborated in detail, is more uniform and more powerful than it first appears.},

	abstract = {Considering the biological or artificial control of a trajectory generation, we propose a biologically plausible model based on harmonic potentials. Such methods assume that obstacles to avoid (or constraints not to violate) correspond to maxima of the potential, while the goal corresponds to a unique minimum. The corresponding algorithm thus behaves as if one throws a sheet onto this state space, this hyper-surface relief being elevated on obstacles, with a hole at the goal location, so that finding a trajectory reduces to «roll down» along this relief towards the minimal height location. The originality of the present work is to build an harmonic potential (thus without local minimum) as a finite linear combination of elementary harmonic functions. The set of these components samples the border of the admissible domain bounded by obstacles or constraints. This leads to an internal representation of the problem as a non-topographical map increment- ally builded during the system exploration and non-linearly linked to the real problem geometry. As such, it provides a biologically plausible quantitative model of some hippocampus mechanisms and of the related cognitive maps, in coherence with usual biological assumptions about such behavior.},

This paper proposes a new theoretical model for the design of creativity-enhancing interfaces. The combination of user and content creation software is looked at as a creative system, and we tackle the question of how best to design the interface to utilise the abilities of both the computer and the brain. This model has been developed in the context of music technology, but may apply to any situation in which a large number of feature parameters must be adjusted to achieve a creative result. The model of creativity inspiring this approach is Wiggins’ Creative Systems Framework. Two further theories from cognitive psychology motivate the model: the notion of creativity being composed of divergent and convergent thought processes, and the “dual process” theory of implicit vs. explicit thought. These two axes are combined to describe four different solution space traversal strategies. The majority of computer interfaces provide separate parameters, altered sequentially. This theory predicts that these oneto-one mappings encourage a particular navigation strategy (“Explicit-Convergent”) and as such may inhibit certain aspects of creativity.},

With all previous attempts to tighten the screws on this vexed problem unsuccessful – right brains, divergent thinking, defocused attention, default mode network, alpha enhancement, prefrontal activation, etc. (Dietrich and Kanso, 2010) – the neuroscientific study of creativity finds itself in a theoretical arid zone that has perhaps no equal in psychology. We propose here a general framework for a fresh attack on the problem and set it out under 10 foundational concepts. Most of the ideas we favor are part and parcel of the standard conceptual toolbox of cognitive neuroscience but their combination and significance to creativity are original. By outlining, even in such broad strokes, the theoretical landscape of cognitive neuroscience as it relates to creative insights, we hope to bring into clear focus the key enabling factors that are likely to have a hand in computing ideational combinations in the brain.},

This chapter strives to reduce that confusion and makes up-to-date assessments of these types of memory. Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified with the term “working memory”) that seem more attention demanding and do correlate well with these aptitudes. The evidence is evaluated and placed within a theoretical framework depicted in .},

This early system is important to understand because it organizes the adult conceptual system of objects and events and remains its core. With development, the system becomes enriched by lan-guage in several ways, and also by means of analogical extension to non-spatial information. Nonspatial bodily information, such as feelings of force and motor activity, is also added, but remains secondary. It becomes asso-ciated with spatial representations, but except for its spatial aspects is rep-resented in a more inchoate and less accessible fashion.},

This article describes the use of continuous vector space models for reasoning with a formal knowledge base. The practical significance of these models is that they support fast, approximate but robust inference and hypothesis generation, which is complementary to the slow, exact, but sometimes brittle behaviour of more traditional deduction engines such as theorem provers.

The article explains the way logical connectives can be used in semantic vector models, and summarizes the development of Predication-based Semantic Indexing, which involves the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures to represent the concepts and relationships from a knowledge base of subject-predicate-object triples. Experiments show that the use of continuous models for formal reasoning is not only possible, but already demonstrably effective for some recognized informatics tasks, and showing promise in other traditional problem areas. Examples described in this article include: predicting new uses for existing drugs in biomedical informatics; removing unwanted meanings from search results in information retrieval and concept navigation; type inference from attributes; comparing words based on their orthography; and representing tabular data, including modelling numerical values.

The human cost of these disorders is immense, yet treatment options for sufferers are currently limited, with many patients failing to respond sufficiently to available interventions and drugs. High quality ontologies facilitate data aggregation and comparison across different disciplines, and may therefore speed up the translation of primary research into novel therapeutics. Realism-based ontologies describe entities in reality and the relationships between them in such a way that once formulated in a suitable formal language the ontologies can be used for sophisticated automated reasoning applications. Reference ontologies can be applied across different contexts in which different, and often mutually incompatible, domain-specific vocabularies have traditionally been used. In this contribution we describe the Mental Functioning Ontology (MF) and Mental Disease Ontology (MD), two realism-based ontologies currently under development for the description of human mental functioning and disease.

	abstract = {This is the first presidential address of AAAI, the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. In the grand scheme of history of artificial intelligence (AI), this is surely a minor event. The field this scientific society represents has been thriving for quite some time. No doubt the society itself will make solid contributions to the health of our field. But it is too much to expect a presidential address to have a major impact. So what is the role of the presidential address and what is the significance of the first one? I believe its role is to set a tone, to provide an emphasis. I think the role of the first address is to take a stand about what that tone and emphasis should be-set expectations for future addresses and to communicate to my fellow presidents. Only two foci are really possible for a presidential address: the state of the society or the state of the science. I believe the latter to be correct focus. AAAI itself, its nature and its relationship to the larger society that surrounds it, are surely important. However, our main business is to help AI become a science -- albeit a science with a strong engineering flavor. Thus, though a president's address cannot be narrow or highly technical, it can certainly address a substantive issue. That is what I propose to do.},

	abstract = {Several psychophysical studies on human problem solving were performed. These studies involved the following problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the 15-puzzle and variants of this puzzle with different sizes, and finally, the TSP with obstacles. All these problems are difficult combinatorial problems and are considered intractable. However, human subjects were found to produce near-optimal solutions very quickly. For all these problems, a pyramid algorithm was used as a model of the mental representation of the problem, and of the global-to-local process of producing the solution. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the study of human problem solving because the prior research (1) neglected mental representation of problems and (2) it concentrated on easy problems that are not solved well by humans. As a part of this project, a workshop on human problem solving was held at Purdue. After the workshop, a new journal was launched. This is the first journal dedicated to human problem solving.},

(2016) found that a solution accompanied with sudden insight is more likely to be correct than a problem solved through conscious and incremental steps. However, Metcalfe (1986) indicated that participants would often present an inelegant but plausible (wrong) answer as correct with a high feeling of warmth (a subjective measure of closeness to solution). This discrepancy may be due to the use of different tasks or due to different methods in the measurement of insight (i.e., using a binary vs. continuous scale). In three experiments, we investigated both findings, using many different problem tasks (e.g., Compound Remote Associates, so-called classic insight problems, and non-insight problems). Participants rated insight-related affect (feelings of Aha-experience, confidence, surprise, impasse, and pleasure) on continuous scales. As expected we found that, for problems designed to elicit insight, correct solutions elicited higher proportions of reported insight in the solution compared to non-insight solutions; further, correct solutions elicited stronger feelings of insight compared to incorrect solutions.},

Natural embodied and situated agents often solve spatial tasks without detailed knowledge about geometric, topological, or mechanical laws; they directly relate actions to effects enabled by spatio-temporal affordances in their bodies and their environments. Accordingly, we propose a cognitive processing paradigm that makes the spatio-temporal substrate an integral part of the problem-solving engine. We show how spatial and temporal structures in body and environment can support and replace reasoning effort in computational processes: physical manipulation and perception in spatial environments substitute formal computation, in this approach. The strong spatial cognition paradigm employs affordance-based object-level problem solving to complement knowledge-level computation. The paper presents proofs of concept by providing physical spatial solutions to familiar spatial problems for which no equivalent computational solutions are known.},

	abstract = {Early accounts of problem solving focused on the ways people represent information directly related to target problems and possible solutions. Subsequent theory and research point to the role of peripheral influences such as heuristics and bodily states. We discuss how metaphor and analogy similarly influence stages of everyday problem solving: Both processes mentally map features of a target problem onto the structure of a relatively more familiar concept. When individuals apply this structure, they use a well-known concept as a framework for reasoning about real world problems and candidate solutions. Early studies found that analogy use helped people gain insight into novel problems. More recent research on metaphor goes further to show that activating mappings has subtle, sometimes surprising effects on judgment and reasoning in everyday problem solving. These findings highlight situations in which mappings can help or hinder efforts to solve problems.

	abstract = {Creativity and problem solving are two major 21st century skills that are to be addressed in K12 education. In order to better teach these competencies, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of human cognition. For that purpose, computational neuroscience offers both a theoretical framework and recent experimental results enlightening such cognitive processes. Computational cognitive architectures propose to implement operational algorithms to solve problems. Recent approaches combine problem solving with modular and evolutive knowledge representation, in order to be able to solve ill-defined problems, which are expected to require more creativity. Beyond problem solving, some models also replicate tasks assessing two modes of thinking involved in the creative process, either divergent thinking or convergent thinking, or both. This raises the question of regulation between these dual thinking modes, and beyond, between related strategies of exploration and exploitation. In this contribution, we review some of these approaches and identify what could be useful for a computational cognitive architecture to – virtually – solve a specific problem involving tangible artifacts. 
This may contribute to better understand a human learner engaged in this task which could be given in the context of a classroom.},

We describe in details how we model the activity and the learner engaged in such a task, their behavior as well as their possible mental states.

We show how formalizing these elements using an ontology offers a well-defined specification and the possibility of inferring on the observables, allowing to give a better description of the material states and relate them to the learner mental states.

Emerging evidence suggests that abstracted representations in medial prefrontal cortex guide reactivation of related memories during new encoding events, thus promoting hippocampal integration of related experiences.

An exploratory case study is presented to illustrate how this model was used in a pre-service teachers’ technology-enhanced learning (TEL) activity design lesson in a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environment. The results show that the participants significantly improved the quality of TEL design throughout the five phases of SMCKI.

The models we created, using the cognitive architecture Soar, vary by using two distinct methods of retrieval from semantic memory. The knowledge bases used in our models vary in that one uses only collocations and compound words to form word associations while the other is from a crowd-sourced dataset with unrestricted types of word association. The model which best matches human difficulty relies on spreading activation to drive retrieval and uses the crowd-sourced dataset for its knowledge base.},

In conclusion, we suggest that computational thinking ideas outlined in this paper are key to moving students from merely being technology-literate to using computational tools to solve problems.},

The Director-General’s proclamation that “Creativity is our hope” captured the essence of the proceedings and participants saw the focus on creativity as offering solutions to global problems. However, educators tend not to understand creativity appropriately or to value it strongly—and they tend to see it only through Western eyes. Only by considering other cultural views will we gain insights that can inform educational practice in the 21st-century global community. This article discusses some recent studies of creativity, reflecting the growing global interest in it and comparing that interest with established Western perspectives. A more comprehensive, international perspective might support a press for fostering creative thinking in schools and inform practices in our increasingly interconnected world; however, teacher training must introduce teachers to the diversity of views and the expectations of local people.},

In this paper eight frameworks describing 21st century competences were analysed. A comprehensive search for information about 21st century competences was conducted across the official websites of the selected frameworks, resulting in 32 documents that were analysed in detail. Travers and Westbury’s framework of curriculum representations was used to determine horizontal and vertical consistency between the frameworks. The frameworks were compared on their underlying rationales and goals, their definition of 21st century competences, and the recommended strategies for the implementation and assessment of these skills in educational practice. In addition three international studies were examined to analyse how various countries (EU member states, OECD countries) and schools (SITES studies) deal (or not) with 21st century competences. The findings indicate a large extent of alignment between the frameworks about what 21st century competences are and why they are important (horizontal consistency), but intentions and practice seemed still far apart, indicating lack of vertical consistency. The implications of the implementation of 21st century competences in national curriculum policies are discussed and recommendations are provided.},

	abstract = {Creativity is a complex construct that would benefit from a more comprehensive mechanistic approach. Two processes have been defined to be central to creative cognition: divergent and convergent thinking. These two processes are most often studied using the Alternate Uses Test (heavily relying on divergent thinking), and the Remote Associates Test (heavily relying on convergent thinking, at least with analytical solutions). Although creative acts should be regarded compound processes, most behavioral and neuroimaging studies ignore the composition of basic operations relevant for the task they investigate. In order to provide leverage for a more mechanistic, and eventually even comprehensive computational, approach to creative cognition, we compare findings from divergent and convergent thinking studies and review the similarities and differences between the two underlying types of processes, from a neurocognitive perspective with a strong focus on cortical structures. In this narrative review, we discuss a broad scope of neural correlates of divergent and convergent thinking. We provide a first step towards theoretical integration, by suggesting that creative cognition in divergent- and convergent-thinking heavy tasks is modulated by metacontrol states, where divergent thinking and insight solutions in convergent-thinking tasks seem to benefit from metacontrol biases towards flexibility, whereas convergent, analytical thinking seems to benefit from metacontrol biases towards persistence. These particular biases seem to be reflected by specific cortical brain-activation patterns, involving left frontal and right temporal/parietal networks. Our tentative framework could serve as a first proxy to guide neuroscientific creativity research into assessing more mechanistic details of human creative cognition.},

	abstract = {The interdisciplinary nature of STEM education is a fertile ground for the development of transversal competencies. The study of STEM activities requires not only to consider domain-specific knowledge and skills, but also to possess several transversal competences, among them problem solving, creativity and computational thinking to fully benefit from the learning process initiated by these activities. Considering these transversal competencies separately leads to several points of tensions, from a more integrative, holistic point of view. Hence, it is necessary to look at these aspects from a more transdisciplinary position, eventually overcoming limits of disciplinary-orientated approaches thus linking the existing theoretical frameworks and pedagogical practices. In this article we describe how the techno-creative problem-solving framework (TCPS) could enrich the analysis of STEM teaching and learning from a transversal epistemological and didactical position. In order to investigate the transdisciplinary potential of TCPS, we provide the analysis of two problem-solving tasks, Tower of Hanoi and CreaCube. The analysis of these tasks through the TCPS raises the existing tensions on how problem solving, creativity and computational thinking are considered in different domains to highlight commonalities and differences between different approaches and to deepen the discussion about their possible connections.},

Decision neuroscience studies have suggested a dissociation between the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC and dmPFC), which would provide estimates of goal value and action cost, respectively. However, this general idea of opponent reward and effort systems has been challenged by several studies that suggested alternative functional dissociations. These contradictions might reflect the diversity of tasks used to investigate the reward/effort tradeoff, and/or the confusion with a metacognitive tradeoff that minimizes the duration of deliberation while maximizing confidence in the behavioral response. Here, we used an original approach with the goal of identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. FMRI results confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with attributes of options but with metacognitive estimates, confidence level being computed in the mPFC and deliberation time in the dmPFC. Thus, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.},

Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising computational approach that may eventually yield comparable problem-solving behaviour in artificial agents and robots. However, so far, the problem-solving abilities of many human and non-human animals are clearly superior to those of artificial systems. Here we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired hierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial agents. We first review the literature in cognitive psychology to highlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive processing. Then we relate the gained insights with contemporary hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. Interestingly, our results suggest that all identified cognitive mechanisms have been implemented individually in isolated computational architectures, raising the question of why there exists no single unifying architecture that integrates them. As our final contribution, we address this question by providing an integrative perspective on the computational challenges to develop such a unifying architecture. We expect our results to guide the development of more sophisticated cognitively inspired hierarchical machine learning architectures.},

	abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to bridge the process of scientific reasoning with the field of cognitive science, and more specifically, the cognitive mechanisms involved during reasoning. This intent of bridging scientific reasoning with cognitive mechanisms gave birth to a new model: the “Z” model of scientific reasoning. This model integrates the traditional scientific reasoning steps while depicting the cognitive mechanisms and mental flexibilities at use during reasoning. The goal of this experiment was to test the “Z” model and thus investigate the role of divergent and convergent thinking during scientific reasoning. In addition, the “Z” model highlights the importance of Contextual Focus during scientific reasoning. Contextual Focus is defined as the cognitive shift between modes of thoughts. Contextual Focus was tested to investigate its predictive power on our specific measure of scientific reasoning (Bouncing Ball Reasoning Task; BBRT) and a broader measure of scientific reasoning (Lawson Test of Scientific Reasoning; LTSR). In addition, the predictive power over scientific reasoning performances of Intellect and Openness, the personality traits of interest, was also tested. First, we hypothesized that participants experimentally primed to think divergently should perform better during the exploration of the problem space during a scientific reasoning task (Phase 1 of BBRT). As predicted, participants in the divergent thinking group generated on average more hypotheses than the participants in the convergent thinking and the control groups. Secondly, we hypothesized that participants experimentally primed to think convergently should perform better during the exploitation of the evaluative space during a scientific reasoning task (Phase 2 of BBRT). As predicted, participants in the convergent thinking group displayed on average fewer categorical errors than the participants in the divergent thinking or the control groups. In addition, Contextual Focus was found to be a significant predictor of the overall performance in exploring the problem space of our specific scientific reasoning problem. Intellect score over broader scientific reasoning (LTSR) performance, Contextual Focus and Intellect were found to be significant predictors of broader scientific reasoning (LTSR) performance. Those findings can also be interpreted with broader cognitive science lenses. Given that complex mental tasks such as problem solving and critical thinking also require divergent and convergent thinking, future research should test whether the priming used during our experimental protocol also leads to an advantage on more general reasoning tasks.},

Economists have long argued on theoretical grounds that humans typically make these choices as if the values of the options they consider have been mapped to a single common scale for comparison. Neuroimaging studies in humans have recently begun to suggest the existence of a small group of specific brain sites that appear to encode the subjective values of different types of rewards on a neural common scale, almost exactly as predicted by theory. We have conducted a meta analysis using data from thirteen different functional magnetic resonance imaging studies published in recent years and we show that the principle brain area associated with this common representation is a subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The data available today suggest that this common valuation path is a core system that participates in day-to-day decision making suggesting both a neurobiological foundation for standard economic theory and a tool for measuring preferences neurobiologically. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility that our emerging understanding of the neural mechanisms for valuation and choice may provide fundamental insights into pathological choice behaviors like addiction, obesity and gambling.},

	abstract = {This work is realized within the scope of a general attempt to understand parametric adaptation, regarding visual perception. The key idea is to analyze how we may use multi-model parametric estimation as a 1st step towards categorization. More generally, the goal is to formalize how the notion of ``objects'' or ``events'' in an application may be reduced to a choice in a hierarchy of parametric models used to estimate the underlying data categorization. These mechanisms are to be linked with what occurs in the cerebral cortex where object recognition corresponds to a parametric neuronal estimation (see for instanced Page 2000 for a discussion and Freedman et al 2001 for an example regarding the primate visual cortex). We thus hope to bring here an algorithmic element in relation with the ``grand-ma'' neuron modelization. We thus revisit the problem of parameter estimation in computer vision, presented here as a simple optimization problem, considering (i) non-linear implicit measurement equations and parameter constraints, plus (ii) robust estimation in the presence of outliers and (iii) multi-model comparisons. Here, (1) a projection algorithm based on generalizations of square-root decompositions allows an efficient and numerically stable local resolution of a set of non-linear equations. On the other hand, (2) a robust estimation module of a hierarchy of non-linear models has been designed and validated. A step ahead, the software architecture of the estimation module is discussed with the goal of being integrated in reactive software environments or within applications with time constraints.},

A problem space consists of a set of states and a set of operators that transform one state into another. Starting from an initial state the problem solver applies a sequence of operators in an attempt to reach a desired state. Soar uses a production system1 to implement elementary operators, tests for goal satisfaction and failure, and search control — information relevant to the selection of goals, problem spaces, states, and operators. It is possible to use a problem space that has no search control, only operators and goal recognizers. Such a space will work correctly, but will be slow because of the amount of search required.},

Most textbooks have a discussion of moral development, but this textbook has a chapter on cultural beliefs, including moral development, religious beliefs, political beliefs, and a discussion of individualistic and collectivistic beliefs in various cultures. The chapter on cultural beliefs provides a good basis for a cultural understanding of adolescent development, because it emphasizes how the judgments we make about how adolescents should think and act are almost always rooted in beliefs we have learned in the course of growing up in a particular culture. In this textbook there is a chapter on gender that focuses on cultural variations and historical changes in gender roles, in addition to discussions of gender issues in other chapters This textbook also has an entire chapter on work, which is central to the lives of adolescents in developing countries because a high proportion of them are not in school. Each chapter contains a number of critical thinking questions the purpose of which is to inspire students to a higher level of analysis and reflection about the ideas and information in the chapters--higher, that is, than they would be likely to achieve simply by reading the chapter.

Taking into account the realistic fact that the spike time is only known within some finite precision, we propose a model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time scale, which can be arbitrary small (in particular, well beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical characterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The asymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose number and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the synaptic weights space, traditionally called the ``edge of chaos'', a notion mathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the edge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane potential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is entirely ``in the spikes'' in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order parameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion of entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational capabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational capabilities of leaky and Integrate-and-Fire models and conductance based models. The present study considers networks with constant input, and without time-dependent plasticity, but the framework has been designed for both extensions.},

Specifically, we show that there is no evidence for intention-independent action, and that attempts to use the criterion of reward sensitivity and rationality to differentiate between intentional and automatic action are conceptually unsound. As a more parsimonious, and more feasible, alternative we suggest a unitary approach to action control, according to which actions are (i) represented by codes of their perceptual effects, (ii) selected by matching intention-sensitive selection criteria, and (ii) moderated by metacontrol states.},

The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a masked view of the input in a self-distillation setup using a standard Transformer architecture. Instead of predicting modality-specific targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which are local in nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information from the entire input.

We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies in ERIC, IEEE, Springer, and Web of Science databases.

Learning is mainly evaluated by direct measures, while indirect measures mostly assess engagement and usability. The use of indirect measures and instruments without psychometric qualities compromises the strength of the evidence for the effectiveness of game-based learning.

We also show that a global processing mode is associated with cognitive flexibility, but only leads to high originality in tasks that capitalise on cognitive flexibility. We finally show that activating positive mood states enhance creativity because they stimulate flexibility, while activating negative mood states can enhance creativity because they stimulate persistence.

Taking a classroom-based example of poststructuralist methodology as its starting point, Anna Herbert’s investigation explores the relationship between creativity seen in psychological activity, such as dreams, and creativity seen in the classroom, asking the following questions:


What might a methodology which taps into different forms of creativity look like? 


Could such a methodology support current neuropsychological theories of memory and learning? 


What are the consequences of imaginary and symbolic orders of knowledge for the understanding of both conscious and unconscious creativity in the classroom?

Exploring the ideas of a number of psychological analysts including Jacques Lacan’s four discourses, concepts of ‘the other’ and the theories of Postructuralist thinkers including Levinas, Mead and Kristeva, Herbert explains how different theories can be used to develop creativity in the classroom and surmount obstacles preventing creative environments.
Clearly presenting both theoretical positions and their bearing on classroom practice, teachers at all levels will benefit from this innovative approach to creativity, as will school psychologists and all professionals interested in the links between psychoanalysis and pedagogy.

	title = {A protocol analysis of use of forward and backward reasoning during valuation problem solving},
	volume = {37},
	doi = {10.1108/PM-10-2018-0056},
	abstract = {Purpose
Behavioural studies of valuers have suggested that valuers rely on a number of cognitive strategies involving reasoning and intuition when undertaking a valuation task. However, there are few studies of the actual reasoning mechanisms in valuation. In other fields, much attention has been paid to forward and backward reasoning, as this shows the choices and decisions that are made in undertaking a complex task. This paper studied this during a valuation task. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to develop a methodological approach for empirical research on valuers’ reasoning, and, second, to report expert-novice differences on valuers’ use of forward and backward reasoning during a valuation problem solving.

Design/methodology/approach
The study utilised a verbal protocol analysis (VPA) to elicit think-aloud data from a purposive sample of a group of valuers of different levels of expertise undertaking a commercial-valuation task. Through a content analysis interpretive strategy, the transcripts were analysed into different cognitive segments identifying the forward and backward reasoning strategies.

Findings
The findings showed that valuers accomplished the valuation task by dividing the overall problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are thereafter solved by integrating available data with existing knowledge by relying more on forward reasoning than backward reasoning. However, there were effects associated with the level of expertise in the way the processes of forward and backward reasoning are used, with the expert and intermediate valuers being more thorough and comprehensive in their reasoning process than the novices.

Research limitations/implications
This study explores the possibility that forward and backward reasoning play an important role in commercial valuation problem solving using a limited sample of valuers. Given this, data cannot be generalised to all valuation practice settings but may motivate future research that examines the effectiveness of forward and backward reasoning in diverse valuation practice settings and develops a holistic model of valuation reasoning.

Practical implications
The findings of this study are applicable to valuation practice. Future training efforts need to evaluate the usefulness of teaching problem solving and explicitly recognise forward and backward reasoning, along with other problem-solving strategies uncovered in this study, as standard training strategies for influencing the quality of valuation decisions.

Originality/value
By adopting VPA, this study employs an insightful and rich dataset which allows an interpretation of thoughts of valuers into cognitive reasoning strategies that provide a deeper level of understanding of how valuers solve valuation problem; this has not been possible in previous related valuation studies.},

Recent advances in quantitative methods based on network science have investigated the effect of aging on semantic memory structure. However, it is yet to be determined how this aging effect on semantic memory structure relates to its overall flexibility. Percolation analysis provides a quantitative measure of the flexibility of a semantic network, by examining how a semantic memory network is resistant to “attacks” or breaking apart. In this study, we incorporated percolation analyses to examine how semantic networks of younger and older adults break apart to investigate potential age-related differences in language production. We applied the percolation analysis to 3 independent sets of data (total N = 78 younger, 78 older adults) from which we generated semantic networks based on verbal fluency performance. Across all 3 datasets, the percolation integrals of the younger adults were larger than older adults, indicating that older adults' semantic networks were less flexible and broke down faster than the younger adults'. Our findings provide quantitative evidence for diminished flexibility in older adults' semantic networks, despite the stability of semantic knowledge across the lifespan. This may be one contributing factor to age-related differences in language production.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the separability of planning, a form of noninsight problem solving, from insight problem solving by means of using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The relationships of these two types of problem-solving tasks with meta-cognitive awareness were also assessed. Participants performed a set of planning tasks, a set of insight tasks and a self-report inventory on metacognitive ability. The CFA results revealed that planning and insight problem solving were closely related constructs and were not clearly separable. Model comparisons indicated that the fit of the alternative one-factor model was slightly better than the fit of the two-factor model. The correlational results showed that both planning task performance and insight problem-solving performance had no correlations with the metacognitive knowledge or the metacognitive regulation components of the metacognitive awareness inventory.},

	abstract = {People’s metacognitions, both before and during problem solving, may be of importance in motivating and guiding problem-solving behavior. These metacognitions could also be diagnostic for distinguishing among different classes of problems, each perhaps controlled by different cognitive processes. In the present experiments, intuitions on classic insight problems were compared with those on noninsight and algebra problems. The findings were as follows: (1) subjective feeling of knowing predicted performance on algebra problems but not on insight problems; (2) subjects’ expectations of performance greatly exceeded their actual performance, especially on insight problems; (3) normative predictions provided a better estimate of individual performance than did subjects’ own predictions, especially on the insight problems; and, most importantly, (4) the patterns-of-warmth ratings, which reflect subjects’ feelings of approaching solution, differed for insight and noninsight problems. Algebra problems and noninsight problems showed a more incremental pattern over the course of solving than did insight problems. In general, then, the data indicated that noninsight problems were open to accurate predictions of performance, whereas insight problems were opaque to such predictions. Also, the phenomenology of insight-problem solution was characterized by a sudden, unforeseen flash of illumination. We propose that the difference in phenomenology accompanying insight and noninsight problem solving, as empirically demonstrated here, be used to define insight.},

	abstract = {One popular and classic theory of how the mind encodes knowledge is an associative semantic network, where concepts and associations between concepts correspond to nodes and edges, respectively. A major issue in semantic network research is that there is no consensus among researchers as to the best method for estimating the network of an individual or group. We propose a novel method (U-INVITE) for estimating semantic networks from semantic fluency data (listing items from a category) based on a censored random walk model of memory retrieval. We compare this method to several other methods in the literature for estimating networks from semantic fluency data. In simulations, we find that U-INVITE can recover semantic networks with low error rates given only a moderate amount of data. U-INVITE is the only known method derived from a psychologically plausible process model of memory retrieval and one of two known methods that we found to be consistent estimators of this process: if semantic memory retrieval is consistent with this process, the procedure will eventually estimate the true network (given enough data). We conduct the first exploration of different methods for estimating psychologically valid semantic networks by comparing people’s similarity judgments of edges estimated by each network estimation method. To encourage best practices, we discuss the merits of each network estimation technique, provide a flow chart that assists with choosing an appropriate method, and supply code for others to employ these techniques on their own data.},

In particular, creative information exploration seeks to discover new, surprising and valuable relationships in data that would not be revealed by conventional information retrieval, data mining and data analysis technologies. While our approach is inspired by work in the field of computational creativity, we are particularly interested in a model of creativity proposed by Arthur Koestler in the 1960s. Koestler's model of creativity rests on the concept of bisociation. Bisociative thinking occurs when a problem, idea, event or situation is perceived simultaneously in two or more "matrices of thought" or domains. When two matrices of thought interact with each other, the result is either their fusion in a novel intellectual synthesis or their confrontation in a new aesthetic experience. This article discusses some of the foundational issues of computational creativity and bisociation in the context of creative information exploration.},

As in the distributed semantics, we define different scenarios containing only some typicality inclusions, each one having a suitable probability. We then exploit such scenarios in order to ascribe typical properties to a concept C obtained as the combination of two prototypical concepts. We also show that reasoning in the proposed Description Logic is ExpTime-complete as for the underlying standard Description Logic ALC.},

We show how such mechanism can be obtained trough a framework of dynamic knowledge generation that is able to tackle the problem of commonsense concept combination. In addition, we show how such a framework can be employed in the field of cognitive architectures in order to overcome situations like the impasse in SOAR by extending the possible options of its subgoaling procedures.},

We show that several studies begin to converge on a set of neural measures derived from the prefrontal cortex that can be consistently linked to processes of self-regulation.

This model is used to explain differing views on the role of education in developing children’s creativity. Our second aim is empirical integration. On the basis of a three-dimensional taxonomy, we performed a systematic review of the recent literature (2006–2017, 184 studies) on primary school students’ creativity. Our results show that creativity is most often measured as a static, aggregated construct.

A new theory of social impact is examined that views social influence as resulting from forces operating in a social force field. It proposes that influence by either a majority or a minority will be a multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of its members. It is suggested that social impact theory offers a general model of social influence processes that integrates previous theoretical formulations and empirical findings and accounts for the reciprocal influence of majorities and minorities. Thus, by viewing social influence as a unitary concept, social impact theory permits comparisons between conformity and innovation and predicts the relative magnitude of their effects.

	abstract = {Image quality assessment potentially benefits from the addition of visual attention. However, incorporating aspects of visual attention in image quality models by means of a perceptually optimized strategy is largely unexplored. Fundamental challenges, such as how visual attention is affected by the concurrence of visual signals and their distortions; whether visual attention affected by distortion or that driven by the original scene only should be included in an image quality model; and how to select visual attention models for the image quality application context, remain. To shed light on the above unsolved issues, designing and performing eye-tracking experiments are essential. Collecting eye-tracking data for the purpose of image quality study is so far confronted with a bias due to the involvement of stimulus repetition. In this paper, we propose a new experimental methodology to eliminate such inherent bias. This allows obtaining reliable eye-tracking data with a large degree of stimulus variability. In fact, we first conducted 5760 eye movement trials that included 160 human observers freely viewing 288 images of varying quality. We then made use of the resulting eye-tracking data to provide insights into the optimal use of visual attention in image quality research. The new eye-tracking data are made publicly available to the research community.},

Results from previous studies indicate that the presence of others can trigger helping behavior, arising from the need for approval of others. Extending these findings, the authors propose that security cameras can likewise trigger such approval-seeking behaviors by implying the presence of a watchful eye. Because people vary in the extent to which they strive for others' approval, it was expected that the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior vary with participants' need for approval. To test these predictions, an experimental study was conducted with “presence of security camera” and “need for approval” as independent variables. Results showed that participants indeed offered more help in the presence of a security camera but only to the extent that this helping involved public or observable behavior. As expected, this effect was more pronounced for individuals high in need for approval. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Here we tested whether such awareness would affect one of the core elements of human cognition: emotional processing and impulse control. Using an emotion stop-signal paradigm, we found that viewing emotionally-arousing erotic images before attempting to inhibit a motor response impaired participants’ inhibition ability, but such an impairing effect was completely eliminated when participants were led to believe that their facial expressions were monitored by a webcam. Furthermore, there was no post-error slowing in any of the conditions, thus these results cannot be explained by a deliberate speed-accuracy tradeoff or other types of conscious shift in strategy. Together, these findings demonstrate that the interaction between emotional arousal and impulse control can be dependent on one’s state of self-consciousness. Furthermore, this study also highlights the effect that the mere presence of the experimenter may have on participants’ cognitive performance, even if it’s only a webcam.},

Analysis of fixation sequences showed that the number of saccades to the cued and uncued objects differed only for saccades that started from the head region, but not for saccades starting from a control object or from a body region. We therefore argue that viewing a person leads to an increase in spontaneous following of the person’s viewing direction even when the person plays no role in scene understanding and is not made prominent.},

We monitored observers’ eye movements while they freely viewed real-world social scenes containing either 1 or 3 people situated among a variety of objects. Building from the work of Yarbus (1965/1967) we hypothesized that observers would demonstrate a preferential bias to fixate the eyes of the people in the scene, although other items would also receive attention. In addition, we hypothesized that fixations to the eyes would increase as the social content (i.e., number of people) increased. Both hypotheses were supported by the data, and we also found that the level of activity in the scene influenced attention to eyes when social content was high. The present results provide support for the notion that the eyes are selected by others in order to extract social information. Our study also suggests a simple and surreptitious methodology for studying social attention to real-world stimuli in a range of populations, such as those with autism spectrum disorders.},

It is well known that the presence of other people (in-person or remote, actual or perceived) increases performance on simple tasks and decreases performance in complex tasks (Zajonc 1965). But little is known about these phenomena in the context of video games, with recent advances finding that they do not necessarily extend to games (Emmerich and Masuch 2018). In Experiment 1 (N=1489; No Observation vs. Researcher Observing), we find that participants observed by a researcher played significantly longer, and performed significantly better, across three video games. Moreover, we find some support that participants observed by a researcher score higher on player experience and intrinsic motivation. In Experiment 2 (N=843; Researcher Observing vs. Professor Observing), we seek to understand whether different roles differing in their perceived evaluativeness would influence the effects of observation. We find that participants observed by a professor had, at times, significantly lower performance, player experience, intrinsic motivation, playing time, and higher anxiety. In Experiment 3 (N=1358; No Observation vs. Researcher Observing), we further validate Experiment 1 by extending our results to three additional game genres. Here, we provide the largest study on observation in video games to date. The study is also the first to show that observer type can significantly influence player outcomes.},

	abstract = {Humans appear to be sensitive to relative small changes in their surroundings. These changes are often initially perceived as irrelevant, but they can cause significant changes in behavior. However, how exactly people’s behavior changes is often hard to quantify. A reliable and valid tool is needed in order to address such a question, ideally measuring an important point of interaction, such as the hand. Wearable-body-sensor systems can be used to obtain valuable, behavioral information. These systems are particularly useful for assessing functional interactions that occur between the endpoints of the upper limbs and our surroundings. A new method is explored that consists of computing hand position using a wearable sensor system and validating it against a gold standard reference measurement (optical tracking device). Initial outcomes related well to the gold standard measurements (r = 0.81) showing an acceptable average root mean square error of 0.09 meters. Subsequently, the use of this approach was further investigated by measuring differences in motor behavior, in response to a changing environment. Three subjects were asked to perform a water pouring task with three slightly different containers. Wavelet analysis was introduced to assess how motor consistency was affected by these small environmental changes. Results showed that the behavioral motor adjustments to a variable environment could be assessed by applying wavelet coherence techniques. Applying these procedures in everyday life, combined with correct research methodologies, can assist in quantifying how environmental changes can cause alterations in our motor behavior.},

The results show that the early processes of error detection and correction (as represented by the error-related negativity and the parietal N1) are not directly affected by subjective awareness of making an error. Instead, they seem to be modulated by the degree of temporal overlap between the programming of the correct and erroneous saccade. We found that only a later component (the error-related positivity [Pe]) is modulated by awareness of making an erroneous eye movement. We propose that awareness of oculomotor capture primarily depends on this later process.},

By detecting eye position, gaze direction, sequence of eye movement and visual adaptation during cognitive activities, ET is an effective tool for experimental psychology and neurological research. It provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gaze, which is very useful in understanding choice behavior and perceptual decision making. In the high tech era, ET has several applications related to the interaction between humans and computers.

It investigates the effects of three different ways of “framing” camera presence on cheating behavior and pro-social behavior. First, we explore the effect of presenting the camera as the medium through which an intimidating authority watches the participant. Second, we test the effect of presenting the camera as being a neutral, non-intimidating viewer. Third, we investigate the effect of watching oneself via a camera. In contrast to most studies on camera surveillance, we will conduct our experiments in an indoor setting. We also explore possible interaction effects of personality traits; we measured Locus of Control, Need for Approval, Self-Monitoring and Social Value Orientation.Methods: In this experiment participated 86 students, randomly distributed over four conditions: three different ways of framing the camera presence, plus a control condition. Our main dependent variables were various kinds of cheating and pro-social behavior. We established the participant's relevant personality traits using a classification tree.Results: For cheating behavior, findings showed that in the “authorative” way of framing camera presence and in the situation in which participants viewed themselves, participants cheated significantly less compared to a situation without camera-surveillance. We did not find significant effects of camera surveillance on pro-social behavior. Looking at personality traits, we found an indication that people with an internal locus of control are more inclined to cheat when there is no camera present compared to people with an external locus of control. However, the effects of our manipulations were stronger.Conclusion: Our findings support the idea that the framing of a camera's presence does indeed influence cheating behavior, adding to the preventive effects of camera-surveillance. Additionally, this study provides some valuable insights into the influence of camera presence on behavior in general.},

	abstract = {The analysis of technical systems is a central activity in design processes. Engineers need to understand the functions of a system in order to gain inputs for further development. In using design research methods in the area of acquiring functional understanding, data is usually gathered through interviews or observations. Since vision is tightly related to cognition, eye tracking may provide deeper insights into the analyzing behavior of humans. This paper investigates the applicability of different eye tracking technologies for research into function recognition. Pilot studies were conducted to show the practicability of the proposed technologies. In addition to that, the paper introduces relevant analysis methods for raw gaze data. The results suggest that remote and head mounted eye trackers are well suited to observing the behavior of engineers who are analyzing a technical system in different representation forms. Based on these findings, the authors propose the use of eye tracking technologies in qualitative and quantitative empirical studies of how engineers build up understanding of technical systems.},

The authors also examined whether this curvilinear relation was moderated by employees’ scores on the openness to experience personality dimension and by the support for creativity employees received from supervisors and coworkers. Data were obtained from 170 employees and 10 supervisors of a manufacturing organization. Results showed an inverted U-shaped creative time pressure-creativity relation for employees who scored high on openness to experience while simultaneously receiving support for creativity. The authors discussed the implications of these results for future research and practice.},

	abstract = {Creativity is associated with finding novel, surprising, and useful solutions. We argue that creative cognitive processes, divergent thinking, abstraction, and improvisation are constructed on different novelty-based processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in creative ideation by providing a control mechanism. Moreover, thinking about novel solutions activates the distant or loosely connected neurons of a semantic network that involves the hippocampus. Novelty can also be interpreted as different combinations of earlier learned processes, such as the motor sequencing mechanism of the basal ganglia. In addition, the cerebellum is responsible for the precise control of movements, which is particularly important in improvisation. Our neurocomputational perspective is based on three creative processes centered on novelty seeking, subserved by the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and dopamine. The algorithmic implementation of our model would enable us to describe commonalities and differences between these creative processes based on the proposed neural circuitry. Given that most previous studies have mainly provided theoretical and conceptual models of creativity, this article presents the first brain-inspired neural network model of creative cognition.},

	abstract = {The present volume is a translation, revision and updating of our book (pub lished in French) with the title "Geometrie Algebrique Reelle". Since its pub lication in 1987 the theory has made advances in several directions. There have also been new insights into material already in the French edition. Many of these advances and insights have been incorporated in this English version of the book, so that it may be viewed as being substantially different from the original. We wish to thank Michael Buchner for his careful reading of the text and for his linguistic corrections and stylistic improvements. The initial Jb. TEiX file was prepared by Thierry van Effelterre.
